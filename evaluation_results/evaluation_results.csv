uksc-2012-0204,"These appeals arise out of a dispute between British Telecommunications Plc (BT), and four mobile network operators.
The dispute is about the termination charges which BT is entitled to charge to mobile network operators for putting calls from the latters networks through to BT fixed lines with associated non geographic numbers beginning in 08.
In 2009 BT notified mobile network operators of a proposal of a revised scheme of termination charges for 08 numbers.
The defining feature of the new scheme was that mobile network operators would be charged at a rate which varied according to the amount which the originating network charged the caller.
The higher the charges to the caller, the greater the termination charge.
The new scheme was rejected by the four mobile net operators party to these appeals.
The issue was submitted to the Office of Communications (Ofcom) under a statutory dispute resolution procedure.
A decision of Ofcom can be appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).
Appeals from the CAT to the Court of Appeal can be brought on points of law only.
Ofcom decided that BT should not be allowed to introduce the new charging scheme because the charges were not fair and reasonable.
This conclusion was based on Ofcoms view that the proposed changes were not sufficiently likely to provide benefits to consumers (the welfare test).
The CAT overturned Ofcoms decision and decided that BT should be able to introduce the new regime.
The Court of Appeal restored the original decision of Ofcom.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the order of the CAT.
Lord Sumption gives the judgment of the court.
The Court of Appeal, finding that it was for BT to justify its charges, had rejected the CATs determination for three reasons, each of which the Supreme Court addresses in its judgment.
First, the Court of Appeal held that the CAT had been wrong to treat BT as having a prima facie right to change its charges, which needed to be displaced.
It found that BT had no more than a right to do so subject to the determination of Ofcom if another party objected [30].
The Supreme Court notes that where, as in this case, Ofcom is resolving a dispute about a proposed variation of charges under an existing interconnection agreement, it is performing a mixture of adjudicatory and regulatory functions.
The terms of the interconnection agreement are the necessary starting point for this process.
Where the terms of the contract permit variation, Ofcom should give effect to that variation unless it would be inconsistent with its regulatory objectives, including under the welfare test [31 34].
Clause 12 of BTs Standard Interconnect Agreement confers a discretion on BT to unilaterally fix or vary its charges, but only within the limits fixed by the objectives of the regulatory environment imposed on it [3637].
BTs power to set its own charges is subject to any order, direction, determination or consent of Ofcom.
However, Ofcom could not just do what it liked.
Its function was to determine whether BT had exceeded the limits of its contractual discretion [38].
In this case, Ofcom has not found that the variation to the charges was inconsistent with the regulatory objectives, including the welfare test.
Ofcom cannot reject the proposed charges simply because they might have adverse consequences for consumers, in the absence of any reason to think that they would [4244].
Secondly, the Court of Appeal held that the CAT had been wrong to attach weight to their view that a restraint on BTs freedom to set its own charges would itself distort competition.
The Supreme Court disagrees with the Court of Appeal for three reasons.
First, Ofcom was not exercising a regulatory function, but resolving a dispute under the unchallenged terms of an existing agreement.
Secondly, the CAT was entitled to attach weight to the value of innovative charging structures as a form of competition.
Thirdly, the CATs conclusion about the anti competitive effects of restricting price changes was a factual judgment.
Since appeal lay to the Court of Appeal only on points of law, the CATs findings on the distortion of competition liable to result from the rejection of the new charging structure were not open to appeal [4647].
The Court of Appeal held that the CAT had been wrong to attach weight to the fact that BT, not having significant market power in a relevant market, was not subject to ex ante control of its prices on competition grounds.
Given the reasoning on the other points, the Supreme Court considers it unnecessary to address this point in detail.
It does however note that the fact that BT does not have significant market power in a relevant market does not mean that the promotion of competition is irrelevant to a dispute about charges.
It only means that Ofcom may not exercise its regulatory power to control prices [4849].

uksc-2010-0156,"On 24 October 2007 and again on both 3 and 13 April 2008 the Respondent, Mr Varma, was stopped at Gatwick Airport and found to be in possession of a quantity of tobacco which he had brought into the United Kingdom without having made payment of the relevant import duties.
On 27 November Mr Varma was convicted in the Crown Court of being knowingly concerned in fraudulently evading duty chargeable on goods, contrary to section 170(2)(a) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.
Following this, on 15 January 2009 the judge made Mr Varma subject to a conditional discharge under section 12 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (the 2000 Act), the condition being that he did not commit any further offence for a two year period from the date of the order.
Confiscation proceedings under Part 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) were postponed until 3 April 2009.
On that date the judge made a confiscation order depriving Mr Varma of the profits of his crimes to the extent of the amount available for recovery.
The judge valued that sum at 1,500 and made a confiscation order in that amount.
On 13 July 2009 Mr Varma sought leave to appeal out of time against the confiscation order on the basis that there was Court of Appeal authority (R v Clarke [2009] EWCA Crim 1074) to the effect that the Crown Court has no power to impose a confiscation order against an offender following conviction for an offence in respect of which the offender has been absolutely or conditionally discharged.
This reflected the fact that the Court could only discharge an offender where it was of the opinion that it would be inexpedient to inflict punishment; this is subject to a number of specified exceptions listed in section 12(7) of the 2000 Act which the Court would not be prevented from imposing on an offender subject to a discharge.
Given that section 12(7) made no reference to confiscation orders the Court in Clarke held that confiscation proceedings could not be brought where an offender is absolutely or conditionally discharged.
The Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal, allowed Mr Varmas appeal and quashed the confiscation order, holding that it was bound by the decision in Clarke.
However, the Court made clear that, but for the decision in Clarke, it would have reached the contrary conclusion and allowed the confiscation order to be made.
The Court of Appeal certified the following point of law of general public importance for consideration by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom: Does the Crown Court have power to make a confiscation order against a defendant following conviction for an offence if he or she receives an absolute or conditional discharge for that offence? The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom granted permission to appeal.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal; the Crown Court has the power and, where the criteria in section 6 of the 2002 Act are satisfied, the duty to make a confiscation order against an offender following conviction for an offence in respect of which the offender has been absolutely or conditionally discharged.
Lord Clarke gives the lead judgment with which Lord Dyson and Lord Reed agree.
Lord Phillips and Lord Mance give short concurring judgments.
Where the criteria in section 6 of the 2002 Act are satisfied the Crown Court is not only empowered to make a confiscation order but, unless it believes the victim of the conduct has started or intends to start civil proceedings against the offender for loss, injury or damage arising from that conduct, is under a duty to make such an order against the offender even where the offender has been absolutely or conditionally discharged following conviction for that offence [58].
The criteria in section 6 of the 2002 Act are satisfied in this case; (a) Mr Varma has been convicted of offences in proceedings before the Crown Court; (b) the prosecutor has requested that the court proceed under section 6 of the 2002 Act; (c) the Crown Court held Mr Varma benefited to the tune of 7,257.86; and, (d) the Court has decided upon the recoverable amount which it valued at 1,500.
Consequently, the Court was under a duty to make a confiscation order to the extent of that amount; even where an offender is absolutely or conditionally discharged.
There is nothing in the Act which gives the Court the power to decline to exercise its duty to make a confiscation order where the criteria in section 6 of the 2002 Act are satisfied.
The Court found that the purpose of section 13(4) of the 2002 Act was neither to prohibit nor to limit the scope of a confiscation order [17].
The reference in section 13(4) of the 2002 Act to deciding the appropriate sentence for the defendant referred to the sentencing process during which the court considers how the defendant should be dealt with.
It is unnecessary to decide whether an absolute or conditional discharge constitutes a sentence for these purposes; it is sufficient that an absolute or conditional discharge is an order made as a result of deciding the appropriate sentence within the meaning of section 13(4) of the 2002 Act [17].
Sections 14 and 15 of the 2002 Act contemplate circumstances in which confiscation proceedings may be postponed until after sentence is imposed.
The Court holds that such a postponement of confiscation proceedings in no way nullifies the courts duty to return to those proceedings after deciding upon the appropriate sentence [20].
The Court acknowledges that there is no express reference to confiscation orders amongst the measures the courts are not prevented from imposing under section 12(7) of the 2000 Act where an offender is absolutely or conditionally discharged.
Nonetheless, the Court holds that the lack of any express reference to a confiscation order in section 12(7) in no way nullifies the duty upon the court to make such an order where the criteria in section 6 of the 2002 Act are satisfied [29 31].
Lord Phillips gives a short concurring judgment in which he questions whether it is legitimate for the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office (Customs), as the prosecuting authority in this case, to seek a confiscation order rather than seeking to exact the duty payable on the goods [59 60].
Lord Phillips questions whether, in confiscation proceedings, it is legitimate to treat a defendant as having evaded duty where the only reason he has done so is that Customs have chosen not to exact it.
Lord Mance gives a short concurring judgment in which he contends that Lord Phillipss suggestion would render it impossible to treat any smuggler as having evaded duty payable on goods, unless and until it is clear that Customs could not pursue and recover the duty.
Lord Mance expresses some doubt as to whether that position accurately reflects the ingredients of the criminal offence created by section 170(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 [61 63].

uksc-2012-0196,"This appeal concerns provisions of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (the Act) designed to address the problem of entrapped patients, namely those who no longer require the level of security afforded by the state hospital but for whom appropriate local services are not available [3 11].
The appellant, G, was tried for rape, assault and breach of the peace in 1998 and acquitted on the ground of insanity.
He is detained at the state hospital at Carstairs under a compulsion order and a restriction order.
G made an application under section 264(2) of the Act.
It provides that the mental health tribunal may, if satisfied that the patient does not require to be detained under conditions of special security that can be provided only at the state hospital, make an order (a) declaring that he is being detained in conditions of excessive security, and (b) specifying a period not exceeding 3 months during which certain duties shall be performed [28 29].
These include the identification of a hospital, which is not a state hospital, in which the patient could be detained in appropriate conditions and in which accommodation is available for him [31].
Decisions under section 264(2) are among those functions that must be discharged having regard, insofar as relevant, to the matters set out at section 1(3) of the Act.
These include the wishes and feelings of the patient (s.1(3)(a)), the importance of providing the maximum benefit to him (s.1(3)(f)), and the need to ensure that, unless it can be justified, he is not treated less favourably than a non patient in a comparable situation would be (s.1(3)(g)) [12 18].
Section 1(4) provides that the function must be discharged in the manner that appears to the person discharging it to involve the minimum restriction on the freedom of the patient that is necessary in the circumstances, after having regard to matters including those in section 1(3) and such other matters as are relevant in the circumstances [22].
Gs application was refused.
At the first stage of its section 264(2) analysis, the tribunal found G did not require to be detained under conditions of special security that could be provided only at the State Hospital.
At the second stage, when considering whether to exercise its discretion to make an order, it had regard to section 1, referring in particular to maximum benefit (section 1(3)(f)) and to the least restrictive option (s.1(4)).
It did not expressly mention the other provisions of section 1(3), (5) or (6).
It found [47 53] that he had recently been subject to the lowest level of security at Carstairs.
He continued to pose some risk of sexual violence towards women and the best way of managing it could only be determined once he had undertaken and completed satisfactorily a course of psychological treatment for sexual offending.
The psychology department at Carstairs was best placed to deliver this treatment, and the tribunal was concerned that G was less likely to engage in it in a medium secure hospital.
Consequently, there was a significant risk that he would become trapped in the medium secure system.
The risk he posed meant he would need to be subject to greater restrictions on his movements in a medium secure hospital than at Carstairs unless and until he completed the necessary treatment, which could take 12 to 18 months.
There was a significant risk of consequential mental health problems.
The tribunal found that it was of maximum benefit to G that he remain at Carstairs.
Gs appeal to the Court of Session was refused.
Before the Supreme Court, he argues that the tribunal: (i) failed to exercise its discretion in accordance with the purpose of section 264: subsection (2) should be interpreted as conferring only a residual discretion to refuse an order in exceptional circumstances at stage 2 where a decision favourable to the application had been reached at stage 1; (ii) was influenced at stage 2 by the risk G posed to women, when consideration of risk ought to have been confined to stage 1; (iii) placed weight on the unavailability of suitable resources elsewhere an irrelevant factor; (iv) failed to have regard to his wishes and feelings and to the need to avoid discrimination; and (v) elevated the importance of providing maximum benefit (s.1(3)(f)) above the least restrictive alternative principle (s.1(4)).
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Reed, with whose judgment the other Justices agree, addresses each ground of appeal as follows: (i) The tribunal understood that section 264(2) involved two stages and what those stages were.
Once stage 1 is satisfied, the application should be granted unless there is some good reason to refuse it [41].
The range of matters the tribunal may take into account is necessarily wide but its discretion must be exercised consistently with the intention of Parliament.
There is no legal reason why it is only in exceptional circumstances that an application should be refused at stage 2 [55]. (ii) Given the nature of a section 264 decision, risk is plainly relevant at each stage of the process.
The increased risk to women which might result from a transfer to a medium secure hospital where there would be female patients was a relevant matter falling within section 1(4)(c).
The finding that the risk would result in greater restrictions in the medium secure unit was plainly relevant to the tribunals section 1(4) assessment, and it was also entitled to have regard, under section 1(3)(f), to the consequential risk to Gs mental health [57]. (iii) Although the unavailability of accommodation does not preclude the granting of an application [38; 42], this does not mean the comparative quality of treatment available at other hospitals is irrelevant.
The tribunal is not prevented from taking into account a clinical comparison [59 61]. (iv) Whilst it did not mention them, it is clear that the tribunal had regard to Gs wishes and feelings insofar as relevant, in particular his wish to be transferred to a medium secure hospital and his attitude towards different forms of treatment.
In relation to section 1(3)(g).
Lord Reed rejects the argument that the provision is irrelevant to the discharge of the section 264 function since a patient is not comparable to a person of full capacity.
It is undoubtedly relevant, but it was enough that the tribunal dealt with the critical issues sufficiently to enable the parties and the court to understand why the application had been refused.
A formulaic rehearsal of every matter in section 1 was not required [64].
It is not readily apparent that the tribunal understood the structure of section 1.
On the facts of this (v) case, however, this cannot have affected the substance of its decision.
It appears most likely that it did not reach a clear conclusion on section 1(4).
In those circumstances, it was entitled to exercise its discretion having regard to all relevant matters and in accordance with the objects of the Act.
Its conclusion that it would be of maximum benefit for G to remain in the State Hospital was reasonable [65 67].
In a short concurring judgment, Lady Hale agrees with a degree of reluctance that the appeal should be dismissed.
She shares Lord Reeds view [43] that it would be unreasonable to make a section 264 order where there was no conceivable possibility of an appropriate bed being found elsewhere, but stresses that such a conclusion is one that a tribunal should be slow to reach.
One must beware the Catch 22 where the patient does not need a high level of security but the facilities offered are not suitable to the level of security he does need by reason of a lack of appropriate work done with him in the state hospital.
In this case she agrees with Lord Reed that the tribunal was entitled to reach the factual conclusion that the patients therapeutic needs would be better met in the state hospital.

uksc-2012-0152,"The issues in these appeals relate to the right to a fair trial.
Alison McGarrigle had a son, Robert, by her former husband.
Robert was subject to a residential supervision order requiring him to live with his father during the week but permitted him to visit his mother on Saturdays.
On 14 June 1997 Robert did not return to his fathers address and instead he and his mother went to live with the appellants in a house in Largs.
A drinking session took place there on or about the 20 June 1997 at which a number of people including the appellants, Robert and Mrs McGarrigle were present.
The next morning she was gone and was never seen by Robert again.
She was reported to police as missing on 16 February 1998.
The investigation continued but in the meantime, on 17 June 1998, the appellants were convicted of sexual offences including offences against Robert McGarrigle and were sentenced to 6 and 8 years imprisonment respectively.
Whilst serving their sentences the appellants were taken by police for questioning on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Alison McGarrigle.
They were asked by the officers whether they were involved in her murder, but they both remained silent.
Owing to a lack of evidence at that time, proceedings were not commenced against the pair.
The appellants were eventually charged in 2005 for the murder of Mrs McGarrigle and remanded in custody.
On 10 June 2010 the appellants were found guilty in the High Court of Justiciary at Glasgow of the murder of Mrs Allison McGarrigle between 21 June and 1 September 1997 and of a subsequent attempt to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of her body in the sea.
In a separate trial held immediately before, the appellants were found guilty of a series of sexual offences relating to children.
Both trials took place in front of the same judge, Lord Pentland, but with different juries.
After the verdict in the first trial the Advocate Depute moved for sentence and handed the judge a list of the appellants previous convictions.
The judge reserved sentencing for the sexual offences until after the trial for murder was complete.
At the time of informing the appellants of this, the judge referred to their records and made comments to them that they were evil, determined, manipulative and predatory paedophiles of the worst sort.
The two issues for the Supreme Court were: (1) when the appellants were charged for the purposes of their right to a trial within a reasonable time in terms of article 6(1) of the Convention (the appellants argued that time started to run when they were first questioned in 1998 and therefore there had been a breach of their right); and (2) whether the comments and conduct of the trial judge were such as to breach the appellants right to a fair trial by an impartial tribunal in terms of article 6(1) of the Convention and, if so, whether the act of the Lord Advocate in persevering with the trial was
incompatible with the appellants rights under article 6(1).
Both issues arose from the refusal of the Appeal Court to grant leave for the relevant grounds of appeal to be argued in the appeal in Scotland.
The Appeal Court did however grant permission to appeal its refusal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court held that it had jurisdiction to consider the issues on the basis that they were compatibility issues in terms of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (as amended by the Scotland Act 2012), issue (1) being an appeal against a decision of the Appeal Court and issue (2) being a reference from the Appeal Court.
The court determines the two compatibility issues as follows: (1) that the date when the reasonable time began for the purposes of the appellants article 6(1) Convention right was 5 April 2005; and (2) that the Lord Advocates act in proceeding with the trial on the murder charges was not incompatible with the appellants article 6(1) right to a trial before a tribunal that was independent and impartial.
The proceedings will be remitted to the High Court of Justiciary [58].
Lord Hope gives the judgment of the court.
The meaning of the word charged has been considered in a number of cases regarding article 6(1), which provides that in the determination of any criminal charge against him a person has the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time and article 6(3)(c) which provides a right to legal assistance for anyone charged with a criminal offence [25 32].
The focus of article 6(3)(c) is on the state of affairs when the suspect is first interrogated, as to wait until the stage is reached when there is sufficient evidence to charge before the suspect has the right of access to a lawyer could seriously prejudice his right to a fair trial.
This is in contrast with the reasonable time guarantee of article 6(1): it relates to the running of time, not on what is needed to preserve the right to a fair trial.
The rationale is the person should not remain too long in a state of uncertainty.
Time runs from the date which the suspects position is substantially affected by the official notification.
In the United Kingdom this could be some time after he is first questioned [33 34].
The date from which reasonable time begins is the subject of a separate guarantee from the guarantee that the trial will be fair and falls to be approached independently [36].
The appellants were certainly not at any stage of their interviews charged in the formal sense.
They were both asked directly whether they killed Mrs McGarrigle.
But, in the context in which these questions were being put, it cannot be said that this amounted to an official notification that they were likely to be prosecuted [37].
In the absence of any evidence to show where, when and how she had died, the police were in no position to initiate criminal proceedings.
In August 2003 they received information that led to further enquiries and resulted in the appellants being charged with murder in 2005 [38].
On the issue of apparent bias, the test is contained in Porter v Magill [2001] UKHL 67 and considered in a number of authorities [47 52].
It would only be if the judge expressed outspoken opinions about the appellants character that were entirely gratuitous, and only if the occasion for making them was plainly outside the scope of the proper performance of his duties, that the fair minded and informed observer would doubt the judges ability to perform those duties with an objective judicial mind.
The context indicates that nothing of the kind happened in this instance [53 54].
Furthermore, no objection was made by the defence at any point to the fact that Lord Pentland was to preside over the murder trial as well and there are no grounds for doubting his impartiality [55 56].

uksc-2015-0154,"For the purposes of the appeal, the Court was invited to assume that Mr Gubay controlled a leisure company, Langstone, of which Mr Willers was a director.
Mr Willers was later dismissed as director of Langstone and in 2010 Langstone sued Mr Willers for alleged breach of contractual and fiduciary duties in pursuing litigation.
On 28 March 2013, Langstone discontinued its claim against Mr Willers.
Mr Willers claimed that the claim brought against him by Langstone was part of a campaign by Mr Gubay to do him harm.
Consequently he sued Mr Gubay for malicious prosecution.
It was not disputed that the alleged actions of Mr Gubay constituted the necessary ingredients for a claim in malicious prosecution (on the assumption Mr Willers could substantiate such claims at trial); the question was whether a claim in malicious prosecution could be brought in relation to civil proceedings by an individual against another individual.
Malicious prosecution already exists in relation to criminal proceedings.
If a malicious prosecution did exist in relation to civil proceedings as between private individuals, then Mr Willers claim would be permitted to go to trial.
The Supreme Court allows Mr Willers appeal by a majority of 5 to 4 ruling that the entirety of Mr Willers claim should be permitted to go to trial.
Lord Toulson (with whom Lady Hale, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson agree) gives the lead judgment.
Lord Clarke delivers a concurring judgment.
Lords Neuberger, Mance, Sumption and Reed give dissenting judgments.
It seems instinctively unjust for a person to suffer injury as a result of the malicious prosecution of legal proceedings for which there is no reasonable ground, and yet not be entitled to compensation for the injury intentionally caused by the person responsible for instigating it [43].
The tort will not deter those who have valid claims.
This was the argument advanced for not allowing the tort in criminal proceedings.
It has no greater merit in civil proceedings [44].
There is a public interest in finality and in avoiding unnecessary satellite litigation, but an action for malicious prosecution does not amount to a collateral attack on the outcome of the first proceedings [46].
The tort does not create a duty of care.
There is a great difference between imposing a duty of care and imposing a liability for maliciously instituting proceedings without reasonable or probable cause [49].
Over the last 400 years there has been a volume of case law
about malice, and the related requirement of absence of reasonable and probable cause, for the purposes of the tort of malicious prosecution [53].
To make out malicious prosecution it is well established that the requirements of absence of reasonable and probable cause and malice are separate requirements although they may be entwined.
In order to have reasonable and probable cause, the defendant does not have to believe that the proceedings will succeed.
It is enough that, on the material on which he acted, there was a proper case to lay before the court.
Malice is an additional requirement.
As applied to malicious prosecution, it requires the claimant to prove that the defendant deliberately misused the process of the court.
The most obvious case is where the claimant can prove that the defendant brought the proceedings in the knowledge that they were without foundation.
But the authorities show that there may be other instances of abuse.
A person, for example, may be indifferent whether the allegation is supportable and may bring the proceedings, not for the bona fide purpose of trying that issue, but to secure some extraneous benefit to which he has no colour of a right.
The critical feature which has to be proved is that the proceedings instituted by the defendant were not a bona fide use of the courts process [54 55].
The combination of requirements that the claimant must prove not only the absence of reasonable and probable cause, but also that the defendant did not have a bona fide reason to bring the proceedings, means that the claimant has a heavy burden to discharge [56].
Lord Clarke delivers a concurring judgment by reference to the arrest of ships, the ingredients of the tort of misfeasance in public office and the close affinity between malicious prosecution of criminal proceedings and malicious prosecution of civil proceedings [60 91].
Lord Neuberger delivers a dissenting judgment with twelve reasons for why the tort of malicious prosecution should not available in respect of civil proceedings between one private litigant and another as well as in criminal proceedings.
The key reasons are that the tort would be inconsistent with the general rule that a litigant owes no duty to his opponent in the conduct of civil litigation [157], inconsistent with witness immunity from civil liability [158], create a danger of satellite litigation [163] and may have a chilling effect on the bringing civil proceedings [166].
Lord Mance delivers a dissenting judgment.
The extension of malicious prosecution is not supported by the authorities [95 129] or by policy because, for example, there is no duty of care owed between litigants [130 140, see 135].
Lord Sumption adds a dissenting judgment.
When recognising new species of non consensual liability, the common law must develop coherently.
The recognition of a general liability for maliciously prosecuting civil proceedings circumvents the principled limits that the courts have imposed on the tort of abuse [178].
Its developments must also be warranted by current values and social conditions.
The courts have far more extensive powers today than they did a century and a half ago to prevent abuse of their procedures [179].
Lord Reed adds a dissenting judgment in agreement with Lords Neuberger and Mance adding observations including a caution against relying on 16th to 18th century cases in a judgments reasoning, especially when constructing their historical context may be difficult [182 3].

uksc-2019-0094,"The Appellant (the taxpayer) operates bingo clubs.
Customers pay a fee, which entitles them to play in a number of bingo games (collectively, a session).
There is no obligation to play every game in a session.
Prizes are paid to those who win games.
VAT is charged on the supply of goods or services.
Council Directive (EC) 2006/112 of 28 November 2006 (the Principal VAT Directive), which currently still applies in the UK, establishes a common system of VAT for member states of the European Union.
The main UK national legislation is the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (the VAT Act) and the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (the 1995 Regulations).
VAT is normally charged on the full amount paid by the customer.
However, exceptionally in the case of commercial gambling the taxable amount is the net sum retained by the organiser after deducting the winnings paid out.
For bingo, the fees charged must therefore be divided into two components: the stake, which is the contribution each customer makes towards the cash prizes, and the participation fee, which is the total fee received minus the stake.
At all relevant times VAT was payable on the participation fee and not the stake.
The present dispute arises from a change in guidance given by HMRC about how participation fees should be calculated.
Until 2007, the guidance stated that bingo promoters should calculate the participation fees separately for each game.
In February 2007, HMRC issued Business Brief 07/07 (the business brief), which stated that participation fees should be calculated on a session by session basis.
This is more favourable to the promoter than the game by game basis as it tends to produce a lower taxable amount.
The business brief stated that Bingo promoters that have calculated the VAT due on participation and session charges on a game by game basis, and who now find that they have done so incorrectly, may make a claim to HMRC for a repayment of any resulting overdeclaration, subject to the conditions set out in Notice 700/45.
Notice 700/45 gave general guidance and stated that a claim was subject to a time limit of three years.
This time limit had a legislative basis in section 80 of the VAT Act.
The taxpayer accounted for VAT on a game by game basis until 2007.
After the business brief was issued, the taxpayer made a claim under section 80 of the VAT Act for repayment of sums overpaid as a result of having used this basis of calculation; because of the time limit in section 80, the taxpayer claimed and was repaid for the previous three years only.
In 2011, the First tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) heard an appeal by another bingo club operator, which argued that it was entitled to make an adjustment without any time limitation.
The First tier Tribunal agreed: Carlton Clubs plc v Revenue and Customs Comrs [2011] UKFTT 542 (TC); [2011] SFTD 1209.
In light of that case, the taxpayer in the current dispute sought to make an adjustment for the years 1996
HMRC declined to accept that.
The taxpayer appealed.
The question for the Supreme Court was whether the taxpayer was entitled to make such an adjustment.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Leggatt gives the sole judgment.
The first obstacle facing the taxpayer was the time limit in section 80 of the VAT Act, which applied to recovery of money paid that was not VAT due to HMRC.
To avoid the time limit, the taxpayer therefore had to argue that all the tax paid on a game by game basis in the years 1996 2004 was due to HMRC [24].
The taxpayer argued that both the session by session and game by game methods were legitimate methods of calculation.
As such, when using the game by game method, it was paying tax that was due and therefore section 80 of the VAT Act, and its time limit, did not apply [27].
Lord Leggatt disagreed; there was only one correct method of calculating the taxable element which was the session by session method [30].
In the present case, it was an agreed fact that a customer purchased a right to participate in a session of bingo [38].
No reason was advanced for going behind the pricing policy adopted by the taxpayer [39].
It followed that if, as a result of using the game by game basis, the taxpayer had paid more VAT to HMRC between 1996 and 2007 than if it had used the session by session method, then the taxpayer had paid tax that was not due.
This means that section 80 with its three year time limit applied, so that VAT paid before 2004 cannot be recovered [41].
This was sufficient to dispose of the appeal.
However, Lord Leggatt went on to address the rest of the taxpayers argument.
The taxpayer sought repayment by relying on article 90 of the Principal VAT Directive, which states In the case of cancellation, refusal or total or partial non payment, or where the price is reduced after the supply takes place, the taxable amount shall be reduced accordingly under conditions which shall be determined by the member states.
The mechanism for adjustments under article 90 is found in regulation 38 of the 1995 Regulations, which applies where there is an increase or a decrease in consideration for a supply.
There is no time limit for making such adjustments [45].
The taxpayer argued that where the method of calculation changes and produces a lower amount, there is a reduction in the price / decrease in consideration for a supply for which an adjustment can be made under regulation 38 [46].
Lord Leggatt rejected that argument [47].
Article 90 and regulation 38 apply only where there has been a change in the consideration actually received by the taxpayer, not where all that has changed is the method used to calculate the taxable amount [48].
It would subvert section 80 of the VAT Act if the taxable person could, by adopting a different method of calculation, adjust its liability for all past years.
The taxpayer further argued that the business brief required or invited bingo promoters to change the calculation method and make retrospective adjustments accordingly [57].
This was also not accepted.
HMRC does not generally have the power to issue binding guidance [59] and the business brief was merely HMRCs view of the law; if the taxpayer disagreed, the position would need to be resolved by a tribunal [60].
In any case, the business brief could only reasonably be read as inviting bingo promoters who found that they had incorrectly calculated VAT on a game by game basis to make a claim for repayment under section 80 [64].
It could not be read as inviting promoters to make adjustments under regulation 38 [65].
The business brief was therefore inconsistent with the taxpayers case [67].

uksc-2012-0217,"This appeal is about the jurisdiction of the High Court to grant bail.
In 1973 Martin Corey was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering two police officers.
The respondent, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, released him on licence in 1992.
The Secretary of State referred Mr Coreys case to the parole commissioners on 13 April 2010 to ask whether his licence should be revoked.
The next day a single parole commissioner recommended that it should be.
That recommendation was based on material the Secretary of State supplied, including confidential information from the security services.
The Secretary of State accordingly revoked Mr Corys licence on 15 April 2010.
Mr Corey was taken into custody the next day and has been in prison since then.
Mr Coreys case was then referred, as required, to the commissioners.
The Secretary of State provided information including a gist of material he had certified as confidential.
The single commissioner who initially considered the case read these and the confidential material itself.
In accordance with her recommendation, a full panel of commissioners considered Mr Coreys case at a closed hearing on 25 January 2011.
His interests were represented by a special advocate, who, like the panel, was entitled to see a statement of all open and closed material relevant to the case, including anything undermining the Secretary of State's case.
Mr Cory and his own legal representatives were allowed to see a similar statement in respect of the open material, but not of the closed material.
On 15 August 2011 the panel gave both closed and open judgments.
In the open judgment, they stated that Mr Corey had become involved in the Continuity Irish Republican Army from early 2005 and was in a position of leadership in it from 2008 until his recall to prison.
Since the panel were satisfied that Mr Corey posed a risk of serious harm to the public, they were required to refuse to direct his release.
Mr Cory sought judicial review of the commissioners decision on the grounds (among others) (1) that the gist disclosed inadequate information and (2) that the refusal to direct his release had been based solely or to a decisive degree on the closed material and so breached article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Article 5(4) provides, Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.
Mr Justice Treacy held on 9 July 2012 that the commissioners decision was indeed based solely or decisively on the closed material.
He further found that the allegations in the open material were not specific enough to allow Mr Corey, through his lawyers and the special advocate, to refute them.
The commissioners hearing therefore breached his right to procedural fairness under article 5(4).
Instead of quashing the commissioners decision, however, Mr Justice Treacy directed them to reconsider the case in accordance with his ruling.
He also gave Mr Corey bail pending their decision, since his detention would be in the meantime unlawful.
The Secretary of State immediately applied for a stay of that order and appealed it.
On 11 July 2012 the Court of Appeal decided that the judge did not have power to grant bail, and so stayed that grant.
This Court granted Mr Corey permission to appeal on the bail issue.
Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal allowed the Secretary of States appeal on the article 5(4) issue, which had been heard separately.
The Court of Appeal concluded that the material which had been provided allowed Mr Corey to instruct his advisers effectively, and so article 5(4) was complied with.
This Court refused Mr Corey permission to appeal on that issue.
Whether the High Court could grant him bail is therefore academic, but important enough that this Court allowed the appeal to proceed on that issue.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Mr Coreys appeal.
Lord Kerr, with whom the other Justices agree, concludes that the High Court in Northern Ireland has an inherent jurisdiction to grant bail [1819], provided certain conditions are met.
The question is whether those conditions are met in this case.
They are that it is (a) necessary for the effective disposal of Mr Coreys claim and (b) not contrary to the purpose or spirit of the legislation in question that the court should have power to order his release pending reconsideration of his case by the commissioners [2122].
The judges order that the review of Mr Coreys detention had not been conducted lawfully and that it should be reconsidered was, on its own terms, a full vindication of the right which the appellant had asserted.
On that ground alone, the judge did not have power to order Mr Coreys release [27].
It is important to bear in mind that in the present case the lawfulness of Mr Coreys detention on foot of his recall to prison was not directly in issue.
The focus of his challenge was to the commissioners failure to direct his immediate release and the manner in which their determination was made [25].
In any event, an inherent jurisdiction to order release in the circumstances of this case would run directly counter to the operation of the legislation in question in this case: the Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001.
One of the principal philosophies underlying the Order is expressed in article 6(4) which provides that the commissioners shall not direct a prisoners release unless satisfied that his confinement is no longer necessary to protect the public from serious harm.
And article 3(2) requires that the commissioners have expertise from a variety of fields: one must hold or have held judicial office; one must be a psychiatrist; one must be a chartered psychologist; one must have experience of working with victims of crime; and must have expertise in the causes of delinquency or the treatment of offenders.
This requirement reflects the need to have available a range of specialists who can contribute to what must often be a difficult debate as to whether the rigorous test set out in article 6(4) is satisfied.
Put simply, the legislature has placed in the hands of a panel of experts the difficult decision as to when a life sentence prisoner should be released.
Their role should not be supplanted by a judge who does not have access to the range of information and skills available to the commissioners [3133].
Lord Kerr notes in passing the European Court of Human Rights recent judgment in James v United Kingdom (2012) 56 EHRR 399, which appeared to suggest that, if a prisoner has not had a chance to take the steps necessary to meet the conditions for release, his detention would breach article 5(1) of the European Convention during those periods.
Article 5(1) allows states to imprison people only when justified by law, and requires prisoners not lawfully detained to be released.
Since it is unnecessary to decide the question in this case, Lord Kerr would defer decision on it until necessary.
Lord Mance, with whom the remaining Justices agree, suggests that James should be interpreted as arising only from a secondary obligation, implied by article 5(1), to progress prisoners through the prison system.
Such a breach would not require a prisoner to be released, but would entitle him to damages.
These observations do not form part of the reasoning on which the judgment in this case was based.

uksc-2017-0020,"Mr and Mrs McArthur are Christians who hold the religious belief that the only form of marriage consistent with Biblical teaching and acceptable to God is that between a man and a woman.
They are the owners of a bakery business (Ashers).
Ashers offered a Build a cake service by which customers could request images or inscriptions to be iced onto a cake.
In May 2014 Mr Lee, a gay man, wished to take a cake to an event organised by campaigners for same sex marriage in Northern Ireland.
He placed an order with Ashers for a cake iced with a depiction of the cartoon characters Bert and Ernie and the words Support Gay Marriage.
Mrs McArthur initially took the order but later advised Mr Lee that she could not in conscience produce such a cake and gave him a refund.
Mr Lee brought a claim against the McArthurs and Ashers (the appellants) for direct and indirect discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, contrary to the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (the SORs) and/or on grounds of religious belief or political opinion, contrary to the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 (FETO).
His claim was supported by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.
The district judge in the county court held that refusing to complete his order was direct discrimination on all three grounds.
The appellants appealed by way of case stated to the Court of Appeal, arguing that FETO and the SORs were incompatible with the McArthurs rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
The Court of Appeal served a devolution notice and notice of incompatibility on the Attorney General, who then became a party to the proceedings.
On 24 October 2016 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that Mr Lee had suffered direct discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and that it was not necessary to interpret the SORs to take account of the McArthurs ECHR rights.
On 28 October 2016, before the order dismissing the appeal had been drawn up, the Attorney General gave notice to the Court of Appeal, requiring it to make a reference to the Supreme Court under paragraph 33 of Schedule 10 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
The Court of Appeal concluded that he had no power to do so as the proceedings had ended.
The Attorney General therefore made two references to the Supreme Court of devolution issues under paragraph 34, the first on the validity of FETO and the SORs and the second on whether the Court of Appeal should have made a reference.
The appellants applied for permission to appeal against the order of the Court of Appeal, and this application was heard together with the Attorney Generals references.
The Supreme Court unanimously holds that it has jurisdiction to hear an appeal against all aspects of the Court of Appeals judgment, finding that the Court of Appeal erred in refusing to make a reference pursuant to the Attorney Generals notice under paragraph 33.
It grants the appellants permission to appeal and allows their appeal.
The Court concludes that neither the SORs nor FETO imposes civil liability on the appellants for the refusal to express a political opinion contrary to their religious beliefs.
Lady Hale gives the judgment on the discrimination issues, and Lord Mance that on the jurisdiction issues.
The sexual orientation claim The district judge found that the appellants did not refuse to fulfil Mr Lees order because of his actual or perceived sexual orientation.
The objection was to the message on the cake, not any personal characteristics of the messenger [22], or anyone with whom he was associated [33 34].
The message was not indissociable from the sexual orientation of the customer, as support for gay marriage was not a proxy for any particular sexual orientation [25].
The benefit of the message accrues not only to gay or bisexual people, but to their families and friends and to the wider community who recognise the social benefits which such commitment can bring [33].
Thus, there was no discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in this case.
The political beliefs claim Protection against direct discrimination on grounds of religious belief or political opinion has constitutional status in Northern Ireland [37].
The discrimination has to be on the ground of the religion or belief of someone other than the alleged discriminator [43 45].
As the appellants objection was not to Mr Lee, but to being required to promote the message on the cake, the situation was not comparable with people being refused jobs or services simply because of their religious faith, but it was arguable that the message was indissociable from Mr Lees political opinion.
It was therefore necessary to consider the impact of the McArthurs ECHR rights on the meaning and effect of FETO [48].
Impact of ECHR rights The rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (article 9) and to freedom of expression (article 10) were clearly engaged by this case [49].
They include the right not to be obliged to manifest beliefs one does not hold [52].
The McArthurs could not refuse to provide their products to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or because he supported gay marriage, but that was different from obliging them to supply a cake iced with a message with which they profoundly disagreed [55].
FETO should not be read or given effect in such a way as to compel them to do so unless justification was shown, and it had not been in this case [56, 62].
Jurisdiction The appellants were entitled to appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to FETO notwithstanding their election to appeal to the Court of Appeal by way of case stated.
Although such appeals are usually final under article 61(6) of the County Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1980 (article 61(6)), there is an exception in section 42(6) Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978 in respect of decisions involving any question as to the validity of measures of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
FETO was equivalent to such a measure and the appellants did challenge its validity if it failed to protect their rights.
It was not necessary to decide whether this also permitted the SORs appeal, given the overlap in the circumstances, because of the Supreme Courts conclusions on the Attorney Generals references [63 71].
The Court of Appeal had been wrong to reject the reference requested by the Attorney General under paragraph 33 on the ground the proceedings were concluded.
In principle, appeals are against orders not judgments and, in this context, it is natural to regard the proceedings as live until a final order is issued.
This error had deprived the appellants of the inevitably different judgment on the question of whether the SORs imposed civil liability on them for their refusal to express a political opinion contrary to their religious beliefs, which would have eventually followed.
An appeal to the Supreme Court following such a procedural error was not precluded by article 61(6), which was focused on the point of law not on a challenge to the fairness or regularity of the Court of Appeals process.
Even though the error was collateral to the litigation between the appellants and Mr Lee, it would be overly technical to deny the appellants the benefit of the proper handling of the reference.
An appeal therefore lay to the Supreme Court against all aspects of the Court of Appeals judgment, including its decision in respect of the alleged discrimination under the SORs as well as under FETO [76 90].
",The Court of Appeal ruled that there was no legal ground for the refusal to bake a cake with the words 'I am a man' on it. The decision was made on the basis that the message of the cake was not relevant to the issue of same-sex marriage. The case was brought by a group of men who wanted to make a cake to celebrate their marriage.,0.08676140613313388,0.03745318352059925,0.061331338818249814,0.07778608825729245,4.0340246928493705e-09
uksc-2016-0107,"Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) is headed Article 8 ECHR: Public Interest Considerations.
Section 117A applies where a court or tribunal needs to determine whether an immigration decision breaches a persons right to respect for private and family life.
In considering the public interest question whether an interference is justified under Article 8(2) the court must have regard to the considerations listed in section 117B and, in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to the considerations in section 117C.
A foreign criminal is a person who is not a British citizen and who is convicted of an offence in the UK that attracted a sentence of at least 12 months, caused serious harm, or is a persistent offender.
Section 117B includes a provision that where a person is not liable to deportation as a foreign criminal, the public interest does not require the persons removal if that person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.
A qualifying child is a person under 18 and is a British citizen or has lived in the UK for a continuous period of seven years or more.
Section 117C provides that deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest but, if sentenced to less than four years imprisonment, there is an exception where there is a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of deporting the person would be unduly harsh on the child.
Three appellants (KO, IT and NS) argue that when determining whether it is reasonable to expect a child to leave the UK, or whether the effect of deportation of a person would be unduly harsh on their child, the tribunal is only concerned with the position of the child and not with the conduct of the parents.
The respondent argued that both provisions require a balancing exercise, weighing the impact on the child against the wider public interest.
The fourth appeal (Pereira, regarding AP) concerns immigration rule 276ADE(1)(iv), which provides that leave to remain on the grounds of private life should be granted to an applicant who is under 18, has lived continuously in the UK for seven years, and whom it would not be reasonable to expect to leave the UK.
APs application was refused on the basis that it was reasonable for him to accompany his parents to their country of origin.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeals.
Lord Carnwath gives the sole judgment, with which the other Justices agree.
General approach The purpose of Part 5A of the 2002 Act is to produce a straightforward set of rules and to reduce the need for discretionary judgement when taking account of public interest or other factors not directly reflected in the wording of the statute.
It also presumed that those rules are intended to be consistent with the general principles relating to the best interests of children [15].
The specific provisions Rule 276ADE(1)(iv) contains no requirement to consider the criminality or misconduct of a parent as a balancing factor and such a requirement cannot be read in by implication [16].
Section 117B of the 2002 Act does not include criminality as a consideration [17].
However, it is inevitably relevant to consider where the parents, apart from the relevant provision, are expected to be, as it will normally be reasonable for the child to be with them.
To that extent the record of the parents may become indirectly material if it leads to them having to leave the UK.
It is only if it would not be reasonable for the child to leave with them that the provision may give the parents a right to remain [18].
In section 117C of the 2002 Act, unduly harsh introduces a higher hurdle than that of reasonableness under section 117B. Unduly goes beyond a level of harshness that may be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context.
It does not require a balancing of relative levels of severity of the parents offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by the section itself regarding length of sentence, and it does not require very compelling reasons [23].
The cases KO and IT concerned section 117C of the 2002 Act.
In KO the Upper Tribunal judge was wrong to decide that he should take account of the criminality of the parent in applying the unduly harsh test [26, 32].
However, this did not affect the correctness of his conclusion, as his overall approach seemed no different to that which the Supreme Court accepts as correct [33 36].
In IT the Court of Appeal was wrong to introduce a compelling reasons test and to proceed on the basis that the assessment of harshness required the nature of offending to be considered [42].
However, the First tier Tribunal had erred in proceeding on the basis, unsupported by the evidence, that ITs child, as a British citizen, could not be expected to relocate outside the UK [44].
The Supreme Court confirms the order of the Court of Appeal for remittal to the Upper Tribunal [45].
NS concerned section 117B of the 2002 Act.
The parents had falsely claimed to have completed a postgraduate course in order to obtain leave to remain [46].
The Upper Tribunal judges conclusion, read in its full context, did not involve any error of approach.
He was entitled to regard the parents conduct as relevant to the extent that it meant they had to leave the country, and to consider the position of the child on that basis [51].
Pereira concerned rule 276ADE(1)(iv).
The Court of Appeal ordered that the case should be remitted to the Upper Tribunal for a fresh determination and it did not limit the issues before the tribunal.
As AP is now aged 19 he is in principle qualified for leave to remain under rule 276ADE(1)(v) and so the appeal may be disposed of by agreement.
If not, it will fall to be considered in accordance with the law stated in this judgment.
No further order is required [54 56].

uksc-2011-0010,"These appeals concern the obligations of insurance companies under various contracts of employers liability (EL) insurance.
In particular, the appeals concern the scope of the insurers obligations to indemnify employers against their liabilities towards employees who have contracted mesothelioma following exposure to asbestos.
Mesothelioma has an unusually long gestation period, which can be in excess of 40 years between exposure to asbestos and manifestation of the disease.
The insurers maintain that the EL policies only cover mesothelioma which manifested as a disease at some point during the relevant policy period.
In contrast, the employers submit that the insurance policies respond to mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos during the relevant policy period but which develops and manifests itself sometime later.
The usual rule in negligence cases is that the claimant must establish on the balance of probabilities that the defendants negligence caused his injury or disease.
In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2002] UKHL 22 and Barker v Corus UK Ltd [2006] UKHL 20 the House of Lords developed an exception to this general principle in cases involving mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos.
The effect of this special rule is that an employer is liable where exposure to asbestos contributed to the risk that the employee would suffer mesothelioma and where the employee in fact develops the disease.
The insurers submit that the special rule in Fairchild/Barker is not applicable when deciding, for the purposes of an EL insurance policy, whether an employees mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos during a particular policy year.
At first instance Burton J held that the policies should all be interpreted as having a causation wording.
He therefore held that the liability trigger under the EL policy was when the employee inhaled the asbestos and not the date when the malignant lesion developed.
A majority of the Court of Appeal (Rix and Stanley Burnton LJJ) upheld the judge in relation to some of the EL insurance policies (particularly those covering disease contracted during the relevant insurance period); however they concluded that other policies (particularly those covering disease sustained during the insurance period) responded only on an occurrence or manifestation basis.
These appeals to the Supreme Court raise two issues: (i) On the correct construction of the EL policies, is mesothelioma sustained or contracted at the moment when the employee is wrongfully exposed to asbestos or at the moment when the disease subsequently manifests in the employees body? (ii) Does the special rule in Fairchild/Barker apply when determining whether, for the purposes of the EL policies, an employee sustained or contracted mesothelioma during a particular policy period?
The Supreme Court dismisses the insurers appeal by a 4 1 majority; Lord Phillips dissenting on the second issue.
Lord Mance gives the main judgment.
To resolve the meaning of the EL policies it is necessary to avoid over concentration on the meaning of single words or phrases viewed in isolation, and to look at the insurance contracts more generally [19].
Several features point the way to the correct construction.
First, the wordings of the policies on their face require the course of employment to be contemporaneous with the sustaining of the injury [20].
Second, the wordings demonstrate a close link between the actual employment undertaken during each period and the premium agreed by the parties for the risks undertaken by the insurers in respect of that period.
Third, on the insurers case there is a potential gap in cover as regards employers breaches of duty towards employees in one period which only lead to disease or injury in another later period [24].
Fourth, on the insurers case employers would be vulnerable to any decision by the insurers not to renew the policy.
A decision not to renew might arise from the employers complying with their duty to disclose past negligence upon any renewal.
Employers who discovered that they had been negligent in the course of past activities in respects that had not yet led to any manifest disease would have such a duty.
The insurers could then simply refuse any renewal or further cover [25].
Fifth, the way most of the policies deal with extra territorial issues throws doubt on any suggestion that the wordings are so carefully chosen that a court should stick literally to whatever might be perceived as their natural meaning [28].
Section 1 of the Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance Act 1969 also points the way to the correct interpretation.
This states that every employer shall insure, and maintain insuranceagainst liability for bodily injury or disease sustained by his employees, and arising out of and in the course of their employment.
In order to give proper effect to the protective purpose of that legislation, the Act requires insurance on a causation basis [47].
There is no difficulty in treating the word contracted as looking to the causation of a disease, rather than its development or manifestation.
The word contracted used in conjunction with disease looks to the initiating or causative factor of the disease [49].
While the word sustained may initially appear to refer to the manifestation of an injury, the nature and underlying purpose of the EL insurances is one which looks to the initiation or causation of the accident or disease which injured the employee.
Accordingly a disease may properly be said to have been sustained by an employee in the period when it was caused or initiated, even though it only developed or manifested itself later [50].
In relation to the second issue, the question is whether the EL policies cover employers liability for mesothelioma arising under the special rule in Fairchild/Barker [71].
Under that rule the law accepts a weak or broad causal link between the employers negligence and the employees mesothelioma.
When construing the EL policies the concept of a disease being caused during the policy period must be interpreted sufficiently flexibly to embrace the role assigned to exposure by the Fairchild/Barker rule [74].
The purpose of the EL policies was to insure the employers against liability to their employees.
Once it is held that the employers are liable to the employees, it would be remarkable if the insurers were not liable under the policies [88].
Accordingly, for the purposes of the EL policies, the negligent exposure of an employee to asbestos during the policy period has a sufficient causal link with subsequently arising mesothelioma to trigger the insurers obligation to indemnify the employer [74].
Lord Phillips dissents on the second issue.
The special approach developed in Fairchild/Barker raises no implication or fictional assumption as to when mesothelioma is initiated.
The consequence is that if claimants have to show that mesothelioma was initiated in a particular policy year in order to establish that insurers are liable they are unable to do so.
This conclusion is not affected by section 3 of the Compensation Act 2009, which did not alter the jurisprudential basis of the Fairchild/Barker approach [132] [133].
","Mesothelioma has an unusually long gestation period, which can be in excess of 40 years between exposure to asbestos and manifestation of the disease. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd and Barker v Corus UK Ltd [2006] UKHL 20 the House of Lords developed an exception to this general principle. The effect of this special rule is that an employer is liable where exposure to. asbestos contributed to the risk that the employee would suffer mesothel.ioma.",0.12297734627831715,0.11831442463533225,0.12297734627831715,0.12297734627831715,7.677981902694667e-07
uksc-2012-0198,"Ahava was a shop in Covent Garden, London, which mainly sold beauty products processed from Dead Sea mineral materials.
The products were factory produced by an Israeli company, in an Israeli settlement located in the West Bank and therefore within the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT).
It was said that the factory was staffed by Israeli citizens encouraged by the Government of Israel to settle there.
Mr Richardson and Ms Wilkinson (the Defendants) sought to disrupt the activities of Ahava.
On 2 October 2010 they entered the shop (together with other helpers) carrying a concrete tube.
They connected their arms through the tube anchored by a chain, secured by a padlock to which they claimed to have no key.
They were asked to leave the shop by an Ahava employee, but failed to do so.
The employee called the police and, after some time, closed the shop.
Tools were used to release the Defendants from the tube.
On their release, they were arrested for aggravated trespass contrary to section 68 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (the 1994 Act).
That offence criminalises the conduct of a person A who (i) trespasses on land, (ii) where there is a person or persons B lawfully on the land who is engaged in or about to engage in a lawful activity, (iii) and A does an act on the land, (iv) intended by A to intimidate all or some Bs from engaging in that activity, or to obstruct or disrupt that activity.
In the magistrates court, the Defendants contested the charge on point (ii).
They argued that Ahavas activities were not lawful since they involved the commission of one or more of four criminal offences.
Firstly, they said that Ahava was guilty of aiding and abetting the transfer by Israeli authorities of Israeli citizens to the OPT, a territory under belligerent occupation.
This was argued to be contrary to Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949, which constituted a war crime.
Ahavas actions in aiding and abetting the transfer, if true, would constitute an offence under sections 51 52 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 (the war crimes offence).
Secondly, they said that since Ahava was aiding and abetting a war crime, Ahava must know or suspect that the products sold in the shop were the products of that offence.
Ahava was therefore, they argued, guilty of the offence of using or possessing criminal property (the criminal property offence).
Thirdly, they argued that the products had been imported into the UK purportedly under the EC Israeli Association Agreement, which conferred tax or excise advantages.
However, since the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled that products originating in the OPT do not fall under this Agreement, they asserted that Ahava was guilty of the offence of cheating the revenue (the revenue offence).
Fourthly, they emphasised that the products sold were labelled Made by Dead Sea Laboratories Ltd, Dead Sea, Israel.
The OPT is not recognised as part of Israel.
Therefore, they argued, Ahava was guilty of labelling offences under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 2008 (the labelling offences).
The district judge in the magistrates court convicted the Defendants.
They appealed, on the grounds above, to the Divisional Court.
The Divisional Court upheld the conviction, but certified as a matter of general public importance the question whether the words lawful activity in section 68 of the 1994 Act should be limited to acts or events integral to the activities at the premises in question.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
An activity is unlawful for the purposes of section 68 only if it involves a criminal offence integral to the core activity carried on, not when any criminality is only incidental, collateral to, or remote from the activity.
Applying that to the facts of this case, none of the offences alleged by the Defendants are integral to Ahavas activities.
The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Hughes.
The effect of section 68 of the 1994 Act is to add the sanction of the criminal law to particular acts which already constitute the civil wrong of trespass.
It is not specifically aimed at individuals wishing to protest, and is to be construed in accordance with the normal rules of statutes creating criminal offences [2 4].
In order to argue that an activity is not lawful, the Defendant has to show a specific criminal offence against the law of England and Wales, which is properly raised on the evidence before the court.
Once that evidential burden has been satisfied, the burden of proof lies on the Crown to disprove that offence to the criminal standard [9].
The Defendants had accepted that a merely collateral offence would not suffice to prove the defence.
They argued that the activity could be defined as the particular feature of Bs acts against which A was protesting or objecting: if that particular feature was unlawful, this would suffice for section 68.
This, however, turns the section upside down.
To apply the section, it is necessary first to consider what Bs lawful activity is, and then to ask whether that is the activity which A intends to disrupt.
The Defendants argument involves considering As motive, rather than As intent: A intends to disrupt the whole activity [12].
The true purpose of section 68 is to add the sanction of the criminal law to a trespass where A disrupts an activity that B is entitled to pursue.
The no lawful activity defence must therefore apply when the criminal offence is integral to the core activity carried on, not merely incidental or collateral to that activity [13].
However, if a criminal offence integral to the core activity is raised, the court must consider that question even if it involves assessing extraneous facts, or the conduct of third parties [14 15].
Applying those principles to this case, none of the offences raised by the Defendants are made out.
The war crimes offence: The only evidence raised by the Defendants was that a different company (the manufacturing company) had employed Israeli citizens at a West Bank factory and that the local community, which held a minority shareholding in that manufacturing company, had advertised the settlement to prospective settlers.
It is very doubtful that the manufacturing companys actions could amount to aiding and abetting the transfer of Israeli citizens to the OPT, but even if it did, this could not amount to an offence by Ahavas retailing arm.
Moreover, any such assistance is not an integral part of the activity carried out by Ahava, which was retail selling [17].
The criminal property offence: If, for the reasons above, there is no aiding and abetting of any unlawful movement of population, the products cannot be the products of a criminal offence.
In any event, the criminal property offence cannot be said to be integral to the activity of selling [18].
The revenue offence: This is a purely collateral offence.
Even if proven, the importer is only liable to repay to the Revenue duty which should have been paid [19].
The labelling offences: These are the principal offences relied on.
The first Regulation criminalises misleading commercial practices, including labelling.
However, it is necessary to show that, as a result of the misleading labelling, the average consumer would buy something that he/she otherwise would not have done.
In this case the district judge had found that a consumer willing to buy Israeli products would be very unlikely not to buy Israeli products because they were produced in the OPT.
Therefore, the offence could not have been committed [20 22].
The second Regulation criminalises the supply of cosmetic products which do not state (among other things) the country of origin.
The aim of this is clearly to protect consumers, and stating that the products derive from the Dead Sea is sufficient: the Regulation is not aimed to reflect disputed questions of territoriality.
Even if an offence had been shown, it would not have been integral to the sale activity [23].

uksc-2009-0048,"RTS specialises in the supply of automated machines for packaging and product handling in the food and consumer goods industry.
Mller, a well known leading European dairy product supplier, entered into discussions with RTS regarding automating its product re packaging process.
While negotiations were continuing, and before the terms of the contract between them had been agreed, the parties decided to start work on the basis of a letter of intent and the understanding that ultimately terms would be finalised.
However, no final contract was ever signed.
A dispute later arose between the parties in relation to the delivery by RTS of certain equipment to Mller.
The main issue to be decided by the Supreme Court was whether the parties entered into a contract following the expiry of the letter of intent and, if so, the terms of that contract.
At the trial of preliminary issues in the High Court, the judge held that after the expiry of the letter of intent and by no later than 29 June 2005, there was a contract: the parties had reached full agreement on the work that was to be done for the price they had already agreed.
The judge held that the contract was based on limited terms and did not include the final draft version of certain terms known as the MF/1 conditions (Mllers standard contract conditions).
RTS appealed the judges conclusions.
The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal and made a declaration that no contract came into existence after termination of the letter of intent.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
In doing so, it reaches a different conclusion from both the High Court and the Court of Appeal finding that although there was no formal contract, Muller and RTS did reach a legally binding agreement and that that agreement contained wider terms than the limited terms found by the judge.
The order of the Court of Appeal is set aside and the court declares that (1) the parties reached a binding agreement on or about 25 August 2005 on the terms agreed on or before 5 July (as subsequently varied on 25 August), and (2) that that binding agreement was not subject to contract.
The judgment delivered by Lord Clarke is the judgment of the court to which all of its members contributed.
The Supreme Court identified the relevant principles to be applied (paragraphs [44] [55]).
It identified three possible conclusions that were open to it: (1) there was no contract between the parties (as held by the Court of Appeal); (2) there was a contract between the parties on the limited
terms found by the judge; or (3) there was an agreement between the parties on some other wider terms (paragraph [56]).
In relation to the first possibility, it is unrealistic to suppose that the parties did not intend to create legal relations.
It was common ground that the parties had agreed the price, which must have formed part of a contract between them.
As the parties accepted that the letter of intent expired and was not revived, the contract containing the price must be some other agreement (paragraphs [57] [58]).
In relation to the second possible conclusion, it is relevant that the parties treated the agreement of 25 August as a variation of the agreement that they had reached by 5 July.
It does not make commercial sense to hold, as the judge did, that the agreement between the parties contained some but not all of the terms agreed by 5 July (paragraphs [59] [67]).
In considering the third possibility, two questions arise: (i) whether the parties intended to be bound by what was agreed or whether there were further terms which they regarded as essential or which the law regards essential in order for the contract to be legally enforceable, and (ii) whether the parties departed from the original understanding or agreement that it was to be subject to contract (paragraph [68]).
In answer to (i), the parties had reached essential agreement by 5 July.
None of the issues remaining after that date were regarded by the parties as an essential matter which required agreement before a contract could be binding (paragraphs [69] [84]).
As for (ii), it is possible for an agreement subject to contract or subject to written contract to become legally binding if the parties later agree to waive that condition.
The court holds that in this case on or by 25 August the parties had agreed to waive the subject to contract provision.
Any other conclusion makes no commercial sense (paragraphs [85] [87]).
The court notes that the case demonstrates the perils of parties agreeing that work should proceed before a formal written contract is executed.
The moral of the story is to agree terms first and start work later (paragraph [1]).

uksc-2013-0258,"This case concerns jurisdiction over claims relating to thefts from two cargo containers.
The first container was allegedly hi jacked in Belgium in September 2011. 756 of an original 1,386 cigarette cartons disappeared from the second container while it was parked overnight near Copenhagen.
The consignors of these containers, and respondents in both appeals, are two companies in the British American Tobacco Group.
The consignors are claiming against the English main contractors, Exel Europe Ltd (Exel), who undertook responsibility for the carriage and also against the sub contractors, the appellants, in whose hands the containers were when the alleged losses occurred.
Exel has played no part in the appeals.
In the appeal concerning the first container the appellants are H Essers Security Logistics BV and H Essers Transport Company Nederland BV (collectively, Essers) and in the appeal concerning the second container the appellant is Kazemier Transport BV (Kazemier).
In both cases the carriage of containers was subject to the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road 1956 (CMR), which is given the force of law in the United Kingdom by the Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965.
Article 31 CMR sets out certain bases on which courts and tribunals can have jurisdiction over disputes arising from contracts of carriage.
Article 34 CMR provides that where a contract of carriage is performed by successive carriers, each is responsible for the performance of the whole operation.
Under article 36 CMR, claims under the contract may be brought against the first and last carriers and the carrier in possession of the goods when the loss, damage or delay occurred.
The issue in the appeals is whether the consignors can found jurisdiction in England against Essers and Kazemeir as successive carriers within the meaning of CMR by relying on the presence in England of, and the proceedings brought against, Exel and/or upon a provision in the main contract for English jurisdiction.
The High Court set aside the service of claim forms on Essers and Kazemeir.
The Court of Appeal reached the opposite conclusion.
Essers and Kazemeir appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court allows the appeals by Essers and Kazemeir and restores the High Courts order setting aside the service of claim forms.
Lord Mance writes the lead judgment, with which Lord Neuberger and Lord Reed agree.
Lord Sumption and Lord Clarke write concurring judgments.
Does Article 31 apply to successive carriers? Article 31 CMR applies to disputes where a successive carrier is involved [19 20, 61].
Article 31 CMR confers jurisdiction only on the courts or tribunals of the jurisdiction (i) as agreed by the parties, (ii) where the defendant is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or the branch through which the contract was made, or (iii) the place of consignment or delivery [33, 62].
In order to found jurisdiction in England, the respondents must bring their claim under one of these heads.
It is common ground that England was not the place of consignment or delivery for either container [31, 64].
Did Essers and Kazemeir agree to English jurisdiction? The appellants became party to the respective contracts made between the respondents and Exel but article 34 CMR qualifies this position by adding that a successive carrier becomes party to the contract of carriage under the terms of the consignment note [23].
It would be contrary to the general principle that contract depends on agreement to hold a successive carrier bound by a choice of court clause, or any other clause not evidenced by the consignment note and of which he had no express notice.
On that basis neither Essers nor Kazemeir were bound by an English jurisdiction clause in the original contracts [26].
Can a claimant bring subsequent carriers into the jurisdiction where it is already suing one carrier? The first, last and performing carriers under article 36 CMR hold joint and several liability, rather than alternative liability [34 42].
CMR reflects a considered decision as to the balance of interests between all potential claimants and defendants and ought not to be interpreted to include an additional head of jurisdiction allowing for a defendant domiciled in one member state to be sued in the courts of the place where a co defendant was domiciled, unlike the article 6.1 of the Regulation on Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments, Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 (the Brussels Regulation) [46 47].
Was England the location of the branch or agency through which the relevant contract of carriage was made? Article 31 CMR refers to the original contract between the consignor and the primary carrier, rather than that through which any successive carrier acceded.
Therefore England is not the relevant location of such branch or agency [32, 66].
Does the Brussels Regulation provide any other basis for jurisdiction or aid the interpretation of the CMR? The Brussels Regulation does not provide any other basis for jurisdiction over Essers or Kazemeir or otherwise act as an aid to the interpretation of the CMR.
The CMR represents a balanced regime adopted across 55 states, only half of which are in the EU.
It does not impinge on any of the principles of EU law which the Court of Justice has, in other cases, held to prevail over such international agreements [48 57].
Lord Clarke and Lord Sumption both consider that the commercial logic of articles 34 and 36 points towards the recognition of a jurisdiction to receive claims against all three carriers in one set of proceedings but agree with Lord Mance that the language of the CMR clearly provides otherwise [60, 69].

uksc-2015-0137,"This appeal and cross appeal arise from the 2008 collapse of the Lehman Brothers group (the Group).
The Groups main trading company in Europe was Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (LBIE), an unlimited company.
LB Holdings Intermediate 2 Ltd (LBHI2) holds all LBIEs ordinary and redeemable shares, except one ordinary share which is held by Lehman Brothers Ltd (LBL).
LBIE, LBL and LBHI2 have all been in administration since January 2009.
LBIE appears to be able to repay its external creditors in full.
Under the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 as amended (the 1986 Act), an administrator of a company is permitted to make distributions to creditors.
Since December 2009, LBIE has been in a distributing administration.
The LBIE administrators declared and paid a first interim dividend to its unsecured creditors in November 2012.
The LBIE administrators received proofs of debt from unsecured creditors including LBL and LBHI2 and the LBL administrators received proofs from LBHI2 and LBIE.
A consolidated set of rules regarding corporate insolvency is set out in the 1986 Act and the Insolvency Rules 1986 as amended (the 1986 Rules) (together, the 1986 legislation).
Schedule B1 to the 1986 Act contains provisions dealing with administration.
Part 2 of the 1986 Rules is concerned with Administration Procedure and Chapter 10 of that Part, which includes rules 2.68 to 2.105, deals with Distributions to Creditors.
The 1986 legislation does not constitute a complete insolvency code and certain established judge made rules may continue to operate.
In a distributing administration, as in a liquidation, the duty of the office holder is to gather in and realise the assets of the company and to use them to pay off the companys liabilities.
A generalised summary of the distribution priorities in relation to such payments (the waterfall) is set out in In re Nortel GmbH [2014] AC 209 para 39.
In February 2013, the administrators of LBIE, LBL and LBHI2 issued proceedings seeking the determination of the court on issues arising in the administrations.
In March 2014, Richards J delivered a judgment, and made ten consequential declarations.
The Court of Appeal (Moore Bick, Lewison and Briggs LJJ) upheld most, but varied some, of them.
The Supreme Court now determines the following issues: Issue 1 concerns the ranking in the waterfall which can be claimed by LBHI2 in its capacity as holder of three subordinated loans made to LBIE, and in particular whether LBHI2s claims rank ahead of statutory interest payable under rule 2.88(7) and/or non provable liabilities.
Issue 2 arises from the fact that LBIEs creditors with debts denominated in a foreign currency will be paid under rule 2.86 at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date LBIE went in to administration, and sterling may have depreciated on the foreign exchange markets between that date and the date of payment.
The foreign currency creditors claim that they are entitled to receive any contractual shortfall as a non provable claim.
Issue 3 concerns whether a creditor of LBIE who had been entitled to, but had not been paid, statutory interest, can claim such interest in a subsequent liquidation.
The remaining four issues arise because LBIE is an unlimited company and so its members can be called upon to make contributions under section 74 of the 1986 Act to meet its liabilities if LBIE is in liquidation.
Issue 4 is whether such contributions can be sought in respect of liability for statutory interest and for non provable liabilities of LBIE.
The other three issues arise because LBHI2 and LBL are creditors of LBIE as well as members of LBIE liable to contribute as such.
Issue 5 is whether LBIE can prove in the administrations of LBHI2 and of LBL in respect of their contingent liabilities to make contributions in LBIEs prospective liquidation if they are called on to do so pursuant to section 150 of the 1986 Act.
If LBIE cannot do this, issue 6 is whether LBIE can exercise a right of set off.
If not, issue 7 is whether LBIE can invoke the so called contributory rule which applies in a liquidation, namely that a person cannot recover as a creditor until his liability as a contributory had been discharged.
Lord Neuberger writes the lead judgment, with whom (i) Lord Kerr and Lord Reed agree, (ii) save on an obiter issue on Issue 2, Lord Sumption agrees, and (iii) save on Issue 2 on which he dissents, Lord Clarke agrees.
Issue 1: LBHI2s contention, which turns on the interpretation of the Subordinated Loan Agreements, is that its claim as subordinated creditor ranks ahead of statutory interest and non provable liabilities because they are obligations not payable in the insolvency of LBIE or (in the case of statutory interest) it is not payable and owing by [LBIE] within the meaning of the Subordinated Loan Agreements.
In agreement with the courts below, the Supreme Court rejects LBHI2s arguments.
Statutory interest is plainly an obligation payable in LBIEs insolvency [48 49].
It is also payable and owing by [LBIE], even though LBIE could not be sued for it [51 56].
Secondly, the notion that a liquidator who meets a non provable liability makes a payment in the Insolvency is implied by the provisions of the 1986 Act and by the practical realities [58 61], and the same applies to an administrator [62].
Accordingly, statutory interest and non provable liabilities must be met before any balance can be used for payment of the subordinated loans [64].
In agreement with the judge and disagreeing with the Court of Appeal, LBHI2 cannot prove for the subordinated loans until the non provable liabilities are paid or clearly could be met [70].
Issue 2: Disagreeing with the Judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court concludes by a majority of 4 to 1 that rule 2.86, which provides that unsecured debts payable in foreign currencies are to be converted in to sterling at the official rate on the administration date, spells out the full extent of a foreign currency creditors rights [90], and so foreign currency creditors cannot claim as a non provable debt the difference between the sterling value of the debt at the administration date and that at the date the debt was paid [112].
This is consistent with the conclusion reached in reports produced prior to the 1986 legislation [88].
It is also supported by the fact that the contrary conclusion would lead to a one way option in favour of the foreign currency creditors [91] and that, in contrast to proofs for certain other debts, there is no provision in the 1986 Rules for their adjustment [93].
It is dangerous to rely on judicial dicta regarding a previous insolvency code [83].
Lord Clarke dissents on this issue [206 and 211 221].
On the wider issue whether the payment in full of a proved debt satisfies the underlying contractual debt, by a majority of 3 to 2 the Supreme Court inclines to the view that it is inconsistent with Chapter 10 of Part 2 of the 1986 Rules, and the natural meaning of rule 2.72(1), that a debt met in full nonetheless has a component which is capable of resurrection [104 107].
Lord Sumption is inclined to disagree on this issue [195 201] and Lord Clarke agrees with him.
Issue 3: Rule 2.88(7) only applies to an existing administration and constitutes a direction to an administrator while in office.
Section 189(2) and rule 4.93 exclude rule 2.88(7) interest being proved for or paid once a company previously in administration is put in to liquidation [117].
In agreement with the Judge and disagreeing with the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court considers that it is impermissible to have recourse to an entirely new judge made rule to fill this gap [120 123].
Disagreeing with the Judge, the Supreme Court concludes that the contractual right to interest for the post administration period does not revive or survive in favour of a creditor who has proved for a debt and been paid on his proof in a distributing administration.
Rules 2.88, 4.93 and section 189 provide a complete statutory code for recovery of interest on proved debts [124 5].
Issue 4: Liabilities in section 74 of the 1986 Act is not limited to those capable of being the subject matter of a proof and includes non provable liabilities [136].
However, rule 2.88(7) provides that statutory interest is payable only where there is a surplus after payment of the debts proved, and, in disagreement with the Judge and the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court holds that section 74 cannot be invoked to create a surplus from which statutory interest can then be paid [139].
Issue 5: section 150 creates a statutory obligation on a member [153] and entitles the liquidator to make the call to fulfil his statutory duties.
Contrary to the view of the courts below, the Supreme Court considers that the nature of that obligation is such that it is incapable of being the subject matter of a proof unless the company concerned is in liquidation [154].
Any money paid under section 74 forms a statutory fund which can only come into existence once that company is in liquidation [156]; if that company not in liquidation, there is no existing person to be identified as a potential creditor, merely a possible future liquidator [158].
Further, the alternative would lead to serious difficulties [160 163].
Issue 6: essentially for the same reasons, prospective section 150 liabilities cannot be set off by the LBIE administrators [171].
Issue 7: It is plainly inconsistent with the pari passu principle and with the statutory aim of enabling effective calls to be made in a liquidation to allow LBHI2 and LBL to be paid out on their proofs like any other unsecured creditor, given that they are probably insolvent [172].
The contributory rule which applies in liquidations can properly be, and should be, extended to a distributing administration, with procedural modifications to achieve consistency with the legislative framework [180 182].

Unless certain consultation requirements (the Requirements), which can be conveniently divided into four stages, are complied with by the landlord, or dispensed with by the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (the LVT), the landlord cannot recover more than 250 from each tenant in respect of works for which the service charge would otherwise be greater.
Section 20ZA(1) of the 1985 Act provides that the LVT may dispense with the Requirements if satisfied that it is reasonable to do so.
The issue on this appeal concerns the width and flexibility of the LVTs jurisdiction to dispense with the Requirements, and the principles upon which that jurisdiction should be exercised.
Daejan Investments Limited (Daejan) is the owner of the freehold of Queens Mansions (the Building).
The Building is managed by Highdorn Co Ltd, which carries on business under the name of Freshwater Property Management (FPM).
Five of the seven flats in the building are held under long leases, each of which is held by a respondent to this appeal (collectively the respondents).
Each lease includes an obligation on the tenant to pay a specified fixed proportion of the cost of providing, among other things, the services which the landlord is obliged to provide, which include the repair of the structure, exterior and common parts of the building.
The respondents were, at all material times, members of the Queens Mansions Residents Association (QMRA).
In 2005, FPM sent QMRA a specification in respect of proposed works to the building (the Works), and appointed Robert Edward Associates (REA) as contract administrator.
REA sent to QMRA and the respondents a notice of intention to carry out the Works, and provided estimates for them, thereby complying with stages 1 and 2 of the Requirements.
REA informed the respondents and QMRA that two tenders appeared to be the most competitive: one from Rosewood Building Contractors (Rosewood); the other from Mitre Construction Ltd (Mitre).
The respondents and QMRA were only provided with the priced specification submitted by Mitre.
Daejan contracted for the Works with Mitre, but in so doing failed to comply with the third of the four stages of the Requirements, which required, among other things, Daejan to issue a statement to QMRA with a summary of observations on the estimates, its responses to them, and notice of where they would be available for inspection.
Daejan requested the LVT to grant it dispensation from the Requirements, so that Daejan would be entitled to recover just under 280,000 in total from the respondents, as opposed to 1,250 in the absence of dispensation.
During the course of the proceedings, Daejan proposed a 50,000 deduction to the 280,000.
The LVT regarded Daejans failure as a serious breach of the Requirements, which amounted to serious prejudice to the respondents.
Accordingly, the LVT refused dispensation.
The Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal agreed with this refusal.
The Supreme Court, by a majority of three to two (Lord Hope and Lord Wilson dissenting), allows the appeal, granting Daejan dispensation from the Requirements on terms that (i) the respondents aggregate
liability to pay for the works be reduced by 50,000, and (ii) Daejan pay the reasonable costs of the respondents in relation to the proceedings before the LVT.
Lord Neuberger gives the majority judgment.
The correct question in this case was whether, if dispensation was granted, the respondents would suffer any relevant prejudice, and, if so, what relevant prejudice, as a result of Daejans failure to comply with the Requirements.
It is highly questionable whether any such prejudice would have been suffered.
The only specific prejudice was a matter of speculation, namely that the respondents lost the opportunity of making out the case for using Rosewood to carry out the Works, rather than Mitre [77].
Although there was a partial failure by Daejan to comply with the third stage of the Requirements, the relevant prejudice to the respondents could not be higher than the 50,000 effectively offered by Daejan [84].
It would be pointless to remit to the LVT the issue as to whether the 50,000 was sufficient compensation [80].
The purpose of the Requirements is to ensure that tenants are protected from paying for inappropriate works, or paying more than would be appropriate.
In considering dispensation requests, the LVT should focus on whether the tenants were prejudiced in either respect by the failure of the landlord to comply with the Requirements [44].
The Requirements are a means to the end of the protection of tenants in relation to service charges [46].
There is no justification for treating consultation and transparency as appropriate ends in themselves [52].
The right to be consulted is not a free standing right [78].
As regards compliance with the Requirements, it is neither convenient nor sensible to distinguish between a serious failing, and a minor oversight, save in relation to the prejudice it causes.
Such a distinction could lead to uncertainty, and to inappropriate and unpredictable outcomes [47] [49].
The LVT has power to grant dispensation on appropriate terms [54], and can impose conditions on the grant of dispensation [58], including a condition as to costs that the landlord pays the tenants reasonable costs incurred in connection with the dispensation application [59] [61].
Where a landlord has failed to comply with the Requirements, there may often be a dispute as to whether the tenants would relevantly suffer if an unconditional dispensation was granted [65].
While the legal burden is on the landlord throughout, the factual burden of identifying some relevant prejudice is on the tenants [67].
They have an obligation to identify what they would have said, given that their complaint is that they have been deprived of the opportunity to say it [69].
Once the tenants have shown a credible case for prejudice, the LVT should look to the landlord to rebut it and should be sympathetic to the tenants case [68].
Insofar as the tenants will suffer relevant prejudice, the LVT should, in the absence of some good reason to the contrary, effectively require the landlord to reduce the amount claimed to compensate the tenants fully for that prejudice.
This is a fair outcome, as the tenants will be in the same position as if the Requirements have been satisfied [71].
This conclusion does not enable a landlord to buy its way out of having failed to comply with the Requirements, because a landlord faces significant disadvantages for non compliance [73].
This conclusion achieves a fair balance between ensuring that tenants do not receive a windfall, and that landlords are not cavalier about observing the Requirements strictly [74].
The minority considers that the LVT should weigh the gravity of the non compliance with the Requirements in determining whether to grant dispensation [111].
This includes distinguishing between breaches or departures according to their level of seriousness, without having first to consider the amount of prejudice they may cause or may have caused [92].
The legislative history of the Requirements suggests that the gravity of non compliance is relevant [103] [109].
Substantial non compliance with the Requirements entitles the LVT to refuse to grant dispensation [91],[110].
Daejans termination of the consultation process represented serious non compliance with the Requirements [99].
Questions as to the gravity of non compliance are questions of fact and degree best left to the judgment of the LVT [88].
Judicial restraint should be exercised by an appellate court where it is prescribing limits on the way an expert tribunal is to perform its functions [89].
The LVTs decision to reject the 50,000 proposal was not based on an error of law that would entitle the Supreme Court to interfere with it [94],[117].
",Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (the 1985 Act) and Service Charges (Consultation requirements) (England) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/1987) impose statutory requirements and restrictions on a landlord.

uksc-2011-0146,"Three prisoners brought appeals concerning the circumstances in which the Parole Board is required to hold an oral hearing.
Osborn was convicted in 2006 following an incident in which he was said to have brandished an imitation firearm at the home of his estranged wife.
He was given a six year prison sentence and was released on licence in February 2009, the halfway point.
He was recalled to prison later that day for breach of his licence conditions [18 29].
Booth and Reilly are indeterminate sentence prisoners who have served their minimum terms.
In 1981, Booth [30 42] received a discretionary life sentence for attempted murder, with a minimum term of six and a half years.
Reilly [43 53] was convicted in 2002 of robbery, attempted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm.
He received an automatic life sentence with a minimum term of six years and eight months, which expired in September 2009.
Both remain in custody.
Each case was considered on paper by the boards single member panel.
It decided not to direct the prisoners release or recommend their transfer to open prison conditions.
Their solicitors made written representations to the board, disputing its findings and requesting an oral hearing in each case, but those requests were refused.
All three sought judicial reviews of the decisions not to offer oral hearings.
Only Reilly succeeded in the High Court, which found that the board had breached its common law duty of fairness, and had acted incompatibly with the appellants rights under article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights1 by failing to offer him an oral hearing.
This was overturned by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeals and declares that the board breached its common law duty of procedural fairness to the appellants, and article 5(4) of the European Convention, by failing to offer them oral hearings [116]. 1 Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.
The judgment, delivered by Lord Reed, emphasises that human rights protection is not a distinct area of the law based on the case law of the European Court, but permeates our legal system.
Compliance with article 5(4) requires compliance with the relevant rules of domestic law [54 56].
The legal analysis of the problem does not begin and end with the Strasbourg case law [63].
Lord Reed sets out guidance (summarised at [2]) on complying with common law standards in this context.
The board should hold an oral hearing whenever fairness to the prisoner requires one in the light of the facts of the case and the importance of what is at stake [81].
By doing so, it will act compatibly with article 5(4) [103].
It is impossible to define exhaustively the circumstances in which an oral hearing will be necessary, but these will often include: (a) where important facts are in dispute, or where a significant explanation or mitigation is advanced which needs to be heard orally in order fairly to determine its credibility [73 78; 85]; (b) where the board cannot otherwise properly or fairly make an independent assessment of risk, or of how it should be managed and addressed [79; 81; 86]; (c) where it is tenably maintained that a face to face encounter, or questioning of those who have dealt with the prisoner, is necessary to enable his case to be put effectively or to test the views of those who have dealt with him [82]; and (d) where, in the light of the prisoners representations, it would be unfair for a paper decision taken by a single member panel to become final without an oral hearing [96].
The purpose of the oral hearing is not only to assist in the boards decision making, but also to reflect the prisoners legitimate interest in being able to participate in a procedure with important implications for him, where he has something useful to contribute [82].
The likelihood of release or transfer is separate from the question of whether fairness requires an oral hearing [88 89].
When dealing with recalled prisoners cases, the board should bear in mind that they have been deprived of their freedom [83].
For indeterminate sentence prisoners, increased scrutiny should be afforded by the board in assessing whether the risk they present is unacceptable the longer they have spent in prison post tariff [83].
The board must be, and appear to be, independent and impartial [90 91] and guard against any temptation to refuse an oral hearing to save time, trouble and expense [91].
Lord Reed stresses that paper decisions are provisional; the right to request an oral hearing is not an appeal, and the prisoner need only persuade the board that an oral hearing is appropriate [94 95].
The common law duty to act fairly is influenced by the requirements of article 5(4); compliance with the former should ensure compliance with the latter [101 113].
Breach of article 5(4) will not normally result in an award of damages under the Human Rights Act unless the breach has resulted in the prisoner suffering a deprivation of liberty [114 115].
An oral hearing ought to have been offered to the appellants.
Osborn and Reilly had advanced various explanations and mitigations [98] and their requests for an oral hearing were mistakenly characterised as appeals [99 100].
In Booths case, input from his psychiatrist at an oral hearing would have been helpful and it was relevant that he had spent so long in custody post tariff [99].
Reillys claim for damages failed it had not been argued that he had suffered any deprivation of liberty as a result of the article 5(4) breach [115].

uksc-2010-0130,"This case concerns the correct approach to calculating beneficial interests in property where the legal title to the property is held in joint names by an unmarried couple but there is no express statement of how it is to be shared.
Ms Jones and Mr Kernott met in 1981.
They had two children together.
In 1985 they purchased a house in Thundersley, Essex in their joint names.
The price paid was 30,000 with a 6,000 deposit paid exclusively by the proceeds of sale from Ms Joness previous home.
No declaration was made as to how the beneficial interest in the property was to be held.
The mortgage and upkeep on the house was shared between them.
In 1986 they jointly took out a loan of 2000 to build an extension.
Mr Kernott did some of the work himself.
The relationship deteriorated and in 1993 Mr Kernott moved out.
From that point onwards Ms Jones lived in the Thundersley property with both children.
In 1996 Mr Kernott bought his own house in Benfleet, Essex.
Over the years, the value of the Thundersley property increased and in 2006 Mr Kernott indicated that he wished to claim a beneficial share in it.
In response, Ms Jones, in 2007, applied to the county court for a declaration under section 14 of the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 that she owned the entire beneficial interest in the property.
By 2008 the property was valued at 245,000.
The county court judge noted that the house was first purchased to set up a family home.
It was bought in joint names and a presumption arose that they intended to jointly share the beneficial ownership of it as well.
Up until 1993 there was no evidence to rebut that presumption.
Ms Jones claimed however that in the 14 and a half years following there was evidence that their common intention had changed.
Mr Kernott had ceased to make contributions towards the running of the house and had made only very limited contributions towards the support of their children.
Furthermore it was mostly during that latter period that the value of the property had increased.
The judge held that their common intention had indeed changed.
In reliance upon the decision of the House of Lords in Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 AC 432, he held that once the initial presumption of joint beneficial ownership is displaced and there is no further clear evidence as to the division of shares in the property it falls upon the court to infer or impute an intention to the parties as to the division of the property that they, as reasonable and fair people, would have intended.
He decided that Mr Kernott was entitled to only a 10% share.
Mr Kernott appealed to the High Court arguing that it was wrong for the court to infer or impute a change of common intention and further wrong for the judge, in effect, to substitute a division that he considered to be fair as between the parties.
Mr Nicholas Straus, QC sitting as a High Court judge dismissed his appeal.
Mr Kernott appealed to the Court of Appeal which, by a majority (Jacob, LJ dissenting), allowed his appeal.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the order of the county court.
Lord Walker and Lady Hale give the lead judgment.
Lord Collins agrees with Lord Walker and Lady Hale and adds some reflections of his own.
Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson agree in the result but reach it by a different route.
Lord Walker and Lady Hale: The principle recognised in Stack v Dowden is that where people purchase a family home in their joint names the presumption is that they intend to own the property jointly in equity also [15].
The starting point is different in cases where the property is bought in the name of one party only.
The presumption of joint beneficial ownership arises because (i) purchasing property in joint names indicates an emotional and economic commitment to a joint enterprise and (ii) the practical difficulty of analysing respective contributions to the property over long periods of cohabitation [19 22].
The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that it was not, or ceased to be, the common intention of the parties to hold the property jointly.
This may more readily be shown where the parties did not share their financial resources [25].
In the absence of clear evidence of intention, a question arises as to when the court can infer such intention and when the court can, instead, impute an intention.
An inference is drawn where an actual intention is objectively deduced from the dealings of the parties; an imputation is one attributed to the parties by the court [26 27].
The search is primarily to ascertain the parties actual intentions, expressed or inferred but if it is clear that the beneficial interests are shared but impossible to infer a common intention as to the proportions in which they are shared, the court will have to impute an intention to them which they may never have had [31].
The following principles apply: (i) the starting point where a family home is bought in joint names is that they own the property as joint tenants in law and equity; (ii) that presumption can be displaced by evidence that their common intention was, in fact, different, either when the property was purchased or later; (iii) common intention is to be objectively deduced (inferred) from the conduct and dealings between the parties; (iv) where it is clear that they had a different intention at the outset or had changed their original intention, but it is not possible to infer an actual intention as to their respective shares, then the court is entitled to impute an intention that each is entitled to the share which the court considers fair having regard to the whole course of dealing between them in relation to the property; and (v) each case will turn on its own facts; financial contributions are relevant but there are many other factors which may enable the court to decide what shares were either intended or fair [51].
On the facts of this case the county court judge held that the parties intentions as regards the Thundersley property had changed after their separation.
It was a logical inference that they intended [Mr Kernotts] interest in Badger Hall Avenue should crystallise in 1995, when they took the house off the market, cashed in an insurance policy, so that Mr Kernott was able to buy a house in his own name [48].
The calculation of their shares on this basis produced a result so close to that produced by the judge that it would be wrong for an appellate court to interfere.
Lord Collins agrees with Lord Walker and Lady Hale, holding that the differences in reasoning set out below are largely terminological and conceptual and are likely to make no difference in practice. [58].
Lord Kerr holds that the divergence in reasoning might, in practice, make a difference [67].
The question concerns how far the court should go in seeking to infer intention and when it is justified in imputing it.
It is preferable to give effect to the parties intentions where possible but the courts should not be reluctant to recognise when it is not and to impute an intention accordingly.
In agreement with Lord Wilson it is not possible to infer the intention in this case but the division that the judge made is a fair one as between the parties and should stand.
Lord Wilson considers that on the facts of this case, it is impossible to infer the intentions of the parties and the court can only impute to the parties an intention that the house be held in fair proportions along the lines of those set out by the county court judge [89].

uksc-2011-0241,"These appeals raise questions about the availability of cross border group relief and the method of quantifying such relief.
These questions arise in respect of claims made by Marks and Spencer plc (M&S) for group relief in respect of losses sustained by two of its subsidiaries: Marks and Spencer (Deutschland) GmbH (MSD), which was resident in Germany; and Marks and Spencer (Belgium) NV (MSB), which was resident in Belgium.
In March 2001, M&S decided to withdraw from its continental European activity.
MSD ceased trading in August 2001 and was dissolved following liquidation on 14 December 2007.
MSB ceased trading on 22 December 2001 and was dissolved following liquidation on 27 December 2007.
Between 2000 and 2008, M&S made several group relief claims in relation to losses sustained by MSD and MSB.
The basic contention underlying all these claims was that the provisions in United Kingdom legislation which restricted group relief claims to losses of UK resident companies and, after the Finance Act 2000, losses of UK branches of non resident companies, were contrary to article 43 EC (now article 49 TFEU) on the freedom of establishment, and were thus unlawful.
The first claims were originally made and refused by the Revenue (HMRC) more than ten years ago.
The matter came before Park J, who made a reference to the CJEU.
The CJEU ruled that article 43 EC did not preclude provisions of a Member State which prevented a resident parent company from claiming group relief for losses incurred by a subsidiary established in another Member State.
The CJEU also ruled that it is contrary to articles 43 and 48 EC to preclude the possibility for the parent company to deduct from its taxable profits in that Member State the losses incurred by its non resident subsidiary where, in one Member State, the resident parent company satisfies two conditions: (i) the non resident subsidiary has exhausted the possibilities available in its State of residence of having the losses taken into account for the accounting period concerned by the claim for relief and also for previous accounting periods; and (ii) there is no possibility for the foreign subsidiarys losses to be taken into account in its state of residence for future periods either by the subsidiary itself or by a third party, in particular where the subsidiary has been sold to that third party.
In giving effect to the CJEUs ruling, Park J, with whom the Court of Appeal agreed, held that the no possibilities test required an analysis of the recognised possibilities legally available given the objective facts of the companys situation at the relevant time, and that the test was to be applied at the date when the group relief claim was made.
On the basis of that approach, the matter then made its way through the Tax Chamber of the First Tier Tribunal, and the Upper Tribunal, before reaching the Court of Appeal.
Moses LJ, with whom Etherton and Lloyd LJJ agreed, disagreed with Park Js approach.
They considered that the claimant should not be given an opportunity to take steps that
might bring about a situation in which it could make a cross border claim.
However, they concluded that they were bound by previous authority and could not depart from it.
In the Supreme Court, four issues arise for consideration.
The parties will be heard as to the answers to be given to three of those issues at a later date.
The first of those issues addressed in this appeal concerns whether the CJEU decided it was contrary to article 43 EC to preclude cross border group relief in the Member State of the claimant company: (a) only where the taxpayer can show, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the end of the accounting period in which the losses in question arose, that there was no possibility of the losses in question being utilised in the Member State of the surrendering company in that accounting period, in any previous accounting period or in future accounting periods (as HMRC contend); or (b) where the taxpayer can show, on the basis of the circumstances existing at the date of the claim, that there has been no possibility of utilising the losses in the Member State of the surrendering company in any accounting period prior to the date of the claim and no possibility of such utilisation in the accounting period in which the claim is made or in future accounting periods (as M&S contend).
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses HMRCs appeal and adopts approach (b).
Lord Hope gives the judgment of the Court.
The exercise to be carried out is essentially a factual one.
The claimant company ought to be given an opportunity to deal with it in as realistic a manner as possible.
It would hardly ever be possible, if regard is had only to how matters stood at the end of the relevant accounting period, to exclude entirely the possibility that the losses in question might be utilised in the Member State of the surrendering company unless, of course, this was prevented by its local law.
The CJEUs judgment in February 2013 in Case 123/11 Proceedings brought by A Oy makes clear that the claimant company is not required to be restricted to such an extent [30].
There is no indication that selecting the date of the claim is likely in practice to give rise to any difficulty.
On the contrary, that date has the advantage of certainty, as the facts to be inquired into will not be susceptible to change between the making of the claim and the commencement of the inquiry.
The entitlement to cross border relief is to be examined, as stated in approach (b), on the basis of the circumstances existing at the date of the claim [31].
The national court will, of course, be alert to the possibility that the claimant company may simply be choosing in which Member State it should be taxed.
However, what M&S was doing can be attributed to the fact that the companies had ceased trading six years earlier, and not to the exercise of an option to choose where to seek relief for the losses that had been incurred.
There is no reason to think that what it did must be seen as a threat to the balanced allocation of taxing powers [32].
Therefore, the question for inquiry is whether the claimant company has been able to show, on the basis of the circumstances known at the date when it makes its claim, that there has been no possibility of the losses in question being utilised in the Member State of the surrendering company in any accounting period prior to the date of the claim and no possibility of such utilisation in the accounting period in which the claim is made or in any future accounting periods [33].

uksc-2009-0223,"This appeal concerns complex statutory provisions relating to corporation tax on financial transactions known as repos.
These provisions have now been replaced.
The general interest of the appeal lies in the approach to be taken to deeming provisions in statutes, namely those which create statutory hypotheses.
A repo is a financial transaction under which shares or securities are sold at one price and are later repurchased by the seller at a different price, fixed in advance.
Although in legal theory a sale and repurchase, in economic substance a repo is a secured loan by the buyer to the seller.
The payment of the purchase price by buyer to seller is the advance of the loan; the shares or securities act as security for the loan; and the repurchase price is the repayment of the loan.
A dividend or instalment of interest may become payable during the period of the repo.
In a gross paying repo, the contract will provide for the interim holder (i.e. the buyer under the repo) to pay that dividend or interest over to the seller.
Such a payment is, for tax purposes, called manufactured interest.
In a net paying repo, the dividend or interest is retained by the interim holder, and the repurchase price adjusted to take account of the receipt.
The Appellant (DCC) and a Bank entered into five consecutive net paying repo transactions in respect of UK government gilts.
For the purposes of this case, these were treated as one composite transaction.
The Bank sold gilts to DCC for 812m.
During the 18 day period when DCC held the gilts, interest of 28.8m (payable half yearly) was received.
The Bank repurchased the gilts for 785m.
The Finance Act 1996 (the 1996 Act) made major changes in the taxation of interest for corporation tax purposes.
Companies are now chargeable to corporation tax on the profits and gains from their loan relationships.
In terms of section 84(1) of the 1996 Act, the credits and debits to be brought into account in respect of a companys loan relationships shall be the sums which, in accordance with an authorised accounting method, and when taken together, fairly represent . all interest under the companys loan relationships.
Because of the approach of the tax legislation, the repos gave rise to three loan relationships.
The question in this appeal was what debits and credits should be brought into account for DCC in respect of three loans relationships.
They were: (1) the actual loan relationship between the UK government and the holder of the gilts.
The payment of interest under the gilts created a credit in DCCs favour, as the holder of the gilts. (2) a deemed loan relationship between DCC (as lender) and the Bank (as borrower).
Section 730A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (the 1988 Act) provided that the difference between the sale price and the repurchase price was to be treated as interest paid by the repurchaser (the Bank) on a deemed loan from the interim holder (DCC).
This deemed payment gave rise to a credit for DCC. (3) a deemed loan relationship between the Bank (as lender) and DCC (as borrower) under which DCC was treated as making a payment of deemed manufactured interest: section 737A(5) of the 1988 Act & 97(2) & (4) of the 1996 Act.
This deemed payment gave rise to a debit for DCC.
The parties agreed that the second loan relationship created a credit to DCC of 1.8m (i.e. the repurchase price of 785m plus the gilt interest of 28.8m minus the purchase price of 812m.) There was no agreement as to the credit in respect of the first loan relationship (the interest on the gilts received by DCC) and the debit in respect of the third loan relationship (the payment of deemed manufactured interest deemed to have been made by DCC).
The Special Commissioner and High Court reached different results.
By a majority, the Court of Appeal concluded that the answer was credit 28.8m, debit 28.8m.
DCC appealed to the Supreme Court.
It argued that the answer was credit 2.9m; debit 28.8m, which would produce an overall debit.
That would be to DCCs advantage, as it could set this against group profits to reduce the group overall tax bill.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, but adopts different reasoning to the Court of Appeal.
It holds that the credit in respect of the interest on the gilts is 2.9m.
The purpose of the deemed payment of manufactured interest by DCC being to cancel out that receipt and to allow it to be taxed as income in the hands of the Bank, the debit for that payment was also 2.9m.
Lord Walker gives the judgment of the Court.
Lord Walker examines the history of the tax treatment of repos.
Under the regime prior to the 1996 Act, in the simple case where no gilt interest was payable during the period of the repo, the interim holder was treated as having made a loan of the sale price to the seller and was taxed on the interest he received on the loan, namely the difference between the repurchase price and the sale price.
This corresponded to the economic reality of a repo.
In a net paying repo, where interest was received by the interim holder during the period of the repo, the interim holder was deemed to make a payment representative of that interest to the seller: [14] [19].
There was a need for symmetry between these two payments.
They were intended to cancel each other out, so that the buyer could be taxed on the repo as if it had made a secured loan at interest, and also to allow the gilts interest to be taxed as income of the seller: [26].
The 1996 Act effected a major change in the taxation of loan interest for corporation tax.
Interest was to be computed in accordance with an authorised accounting method, in this case an accruals basis: [7], [23].
It was reasonable to expect that, when effecting this change, Parliament intended to preserve rather than to destroy the essentials of the existing provisions: [33].
Applying an accruals basis of accounting, DCCs credit in respect of interest on the gilts was 2.9m: the total payment of 28.8m accrued over a 6 month period, and DCC held the gilts for only 18 days: [30], [32], [44].
DCC submitted that applying an accruals basis of accounting to the deemed third loan relationship, the appropriate debit was 28.8m.
No other result was possible, because it would mean that the balance of that payment vanished into the ether.
Lord Walker emphasises that it is important when interpreting a deeming provision not to take the hypothesis further than is warranted: [40].
The payment which section 737A(5) of the 1988 Act deems DCC to make is said to be representative of the interest on the gilts received during the repo period.
Section 97(2)(a) of the 1996 Act provides that this deemed payment is to be treated as interest paid under a hypothetical loan relationship.
It was unwarranted to assume that this hypothetical loan relationship lasted no longer than the repo period, so that the entire payment needed to be treated as accruing during the 18 days during which DCC held the gilts.
The interest on the gilts accrued during a period of six months but DCCs interest in the gilts lasted only 18 days: [42].
Its receipt of interest was therefore apportioned.
The debit under a hypothetical relationship under which DCC was making a payment representative of that interest should also be a time apportioned sum, with the apportionment carried out in the same way: [43].

uksc-2015-0129,"These proceedings relate to applications made by two foreign nationals, Ms Agyarko and Ms Ikuga, residing unlawfully in the UK, for leave to remain in the UK as partners of British citizens with whom they have formed relationships during the period of their unlawful residence.
The Secretary of States decision in each case was that the applicant did not qualify for leave to remain under Immigration Rules (the Rules).
Paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM of the Rules required applicants to have a genuine subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, and for there to be insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.
The Secretary of State found that no evidence had been provided of insurmountable obstacles in either case, and that in the case of Ms Ikuga she had not provided evidence of a shared address in order to show she that had a partner within the meaning of the Rules.
The Immigration Directorate Instructions (the Instructions) state that where an applicant does not meet the requirement of the Rules, leave can be granted outside the Rules where exceptional circumstances apply, in order to ensure compatibility with the applicants rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Secretary of State found that there were no exceptional circumstances in the case of either applicant to warrant consideration of a grant of leave outside the Rules.
Both Ms Agyarko and Ms Ikuga sought permission to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of States decisions.
In each case permission was refused by the Upper Tribunal, and the Court of Appeal upheld that refusal.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeals.
Lord Reed gives the judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees.
The Secretary of States decisions on the facts were lawful.
The ultimate question in article 8 cases is whether a fair balance has been struck between the competing public and individual interests involved, applying a proportionality test.
The Rules and Instructions do not depart from that position, and are compatible with article 8.
It is within the margin of appreciation for the Secretary of State to adopt policies which set out the weight to be attached to the competing considerations in striking a fair balance, including that family life established while the applicants stay in the UK is known to be unlawful or precarious should be given less weight, when balanced against the factors weighing in favour of removal, than family life formed by a person lawfully present in the UK [46 53].
Although the requirement of insurmountable obstacles to a continuing relationship is a stringent test to be met, rather than one relevant factor to be taken in account, this does not make it incompatible with article 8.
The phrase insurmountable obstacles was not defined by the Rules when the present cases were considered, but it is reasonable to infer that it was intended to have the same meaning as in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.
It imposed a stringent test and was to be interpreted in a sensible and practical way rather than as referring solely to obstacles which make it literally impossible for the family to live together in the applicants country of origin.
This is consistent with the guidance on assessing insurmountable obstacles contained in the Instructions, and the definition of that phrase introduced subsequently in the Rules, effective from 28 July 2014 [42 48].
The exceptional circumstances question is also one that the Secretary of State may legitimately ask.
Appendix FM is said to reflect how the balance will be struck under article 8 between the right to respect for private and family life, and the legitimate aims listed in article 8(2), so that if an applicant fails to meet the requirements of the Rules it should only be in genuinely exceptional circumstances that refusing them leave and removing them from the UK would breach article 8.
The Instructions state that exceptional does not mean unusual or unique, but means circumstances in which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that refusal of the application would not be proportionate.
This is an application of a test of proportionality, consistent with the references to exceptional circumstances in European case law and cannot be regarded as incompatible with article 8 [54 60].
On the facts of each case, there was no basis to challenge the conclusions of the Upper Tribunal judge, that no evidence was placed before the Secretary of State from which the conclusion could be reached that there were insurmountable obstacles to each applicants relationship continuing in their countries of origin.
Although in the case of Ms Ikuga the case was considered on an erroneous basis of fact that she was not in a genuine relationship, the insurmountable obstacles test was bound to fail in any event.
Further, neither applicant had put forward anything which might constitute exceptional circumstances as defined in the Instructions.
There was also an argument, advanced for the first time on appeal, that refusal of leave to remain served no good purpose because the applicants were otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter if the application was made from outside the UK.
There was nothing to suggest that this would be the case for either appellant. [69 74].
The effect of refusal of leave in the applicants cases was not a breach of EU law.
The Secretary of States decisions in these cases did not compel an EU citizen to reside outside the EU.
These cases fell outside the situations of dependency to which the Zambrano principle of EU law applies [61 68].
","Two foreign nationals, Ms Agyarko and Ms Ikuga, residing unlawfully in the UK, applied for leave to remain. The Secretary of State found that there were no exceptional circumstances in the case of either applicant to warrant consideration of a grant of leave outside the Rules. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeals.",0.1054726368159204,0.09970089730807577,0.10348258706467661,0.1054726368159204,4.000297686366638e-08
uksc-2011-0156,"These appeals concern the circumstances in which a prisoner serving a life sentence or an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP), who has served the minimum period specified for the purposes of retribution and deterrence (the tariff), and whose further detention is justified only if it is necessary for the protection of the public, should be awarded damages for delay in reviewing the need for further detention following the expiry of the tariff.
They are also concerned with the quantum of such damages.
Since 1997, legislation has required judges to impose life sentences on a wider range of offenders than was previously the case.
In addition, IPPs were introduced in April 2005.
It is for the Parole Board of England and Wales (the Board) to decide whether to direct the release of a life or IPP prisoner whose tariff has expired.
The prisoners case must first be referred to the Board by the Secretary of State for Justice (the Secretary of State).
The increase in the number of life prisoners and the introduction of IPP sentences resulted in an increase in the Boards workload, but its resources were not increased.
This resulted in delay in the consideration of post tariff prisoners cases.
That delay has implications under the Human Rights Act 1998 (the 1998 Act), which gives effect to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention).
Article 5(1) requires that detention must throughout its duration remain causally connected to the objectives of the sentencing court.
In relation to post tariff prisoners, that objective is the protection of the public.
In order to comply with Article 5(4), the Board has to review the necessity for the continued detention of post tariff prisoners speedily upon the expiry of their tariff and at reasonable intervals thereafter.
The 1998 Act also provides that the remedies for a violation of a Convention right include damages.
Mr Faulkner was sentenced in 2001 to life imprisonment for a second offence involving grievous bodily harm.
Mr Sturnham was convicted of manslaughter in 2007 and given an IPP sentence.
In each case, there was a delay in the holding of a hearing before the Board after the tariff had expired, due to administrative errors for which the Secretary of State was responsible.
Both men were eventually released following Board hearings, but Mr Faulkner was twice recalled to prison in respect of allegations of which he was acquitted, and remains in custody.
Each sought judicial review of the failure by the Board and the Secretary of State to conduct a review of his detention speedily, as required by Article 5(4).
Mr Faulkner was unsuccessful in the High Court, but the Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of State had breached Article 5(4), that Mr Faulkner would have been released 10 months earlier than he was but for that breach, and that the Secretary of State should therefore pay him 10,000 in damages.
In Mr Sturnhams case, the High Court held that there had been a breach of Article 5(4) due to a delay of 6 months, that he had been caused anxiety and distress by the delay, but that there was no prospect that he would have been released any earlier had the hearing taken place speedily.
The Secretary of State was ordered to pay him 300, but that award was quashed by the Court of Appeal.
In Mr Faulkners case, the Board appeals to the Supreme Court on the ground that the award of damages was excessive.
Mr Faulkner cross appeals on the ground that the award was inadequate and that his imprisonment during the period of
delay constituted false imprisonment at common law or a violation of Article 5(1).
Mr Sturnham seeks permission to appeal against the Court of Appeals decision to quash the award of damages to him.
The Supreme Court allows the Boards appeal in Mr Faulkners case, reduces the damages awarded to him to 6,500, and dismisses his cross appeal.
The Court grants Mr Sturnham permission to appeal and allows his appeal.
Lord Reed gives the lead judgment, with which Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance and Lord Kerr agree.
Lord Carnwath delivers a concurring judgment.
Mr Faulkners argument that the detention of a life prisoner constitutes false imprisonment if it continues beyond the point at which the prisoner would have been released if a hearing had been held in accordance with Article 5(4) must be rejected.
That detention is still authorised by statute, and is therefore lawful until the Board directs release [16, 86].
Nor was Mr Faulkner the victim of a violation of Article 5(1).
Such a violation requires exceptional circumstances warranting the conclusion that continued detention has become arbitrary, which were not present in Mr Faulkners case [17 23, 86].
On the question of the award of damages under the 1998 Act, the courts should be guided primarily by the principles applied by the ECtHR, which may be inferred from any clear and consistent practice of that court.
The quantum of such awards should broadly reflect the level of awards made by the ECtHR in comparable cases brought by applicants from the UK or other countries with a similar cost of living [39].
The courts should resolve disputed issues of fact in the usual way even if the ECtHR in similar circumstances, due to the nature of its role, would not do so [39, 82].
Where it is established on the balance of probabilities that a violation of Article 5(4) has prolonged the detention of a prisoner past the point at which he would otherwise have been released, damages should ordinarily be awarded.
The amount of such damages will be a matter of judgment, reflecting the facts of the case and having regard to guidance from the ECtHR and the national courts in comparable cases [75].
Pecuniary losses should be compensated in full [53, 70].
Though relevant in some circumstances, it will not ordinarily be appropriate to take into account as a mitigating factor that a claimant was recalled to prison following his eventual release [83].
Nor should damages be awarded merely for the loss of a chance of earlier release [82], or adjusted according to the degree of probability of release if the violation of Article 5(4) had not occurred [84].
Appellate courts do not ordinarily interfere with an award of damages simply because they would have awarded a different figure if they had tried the case.
However, as the Court is in this case being asked to give guidance on the appropriate level of awards, and having regard to awards made by the ECtHR in other cases and to the fact that the liberty enjoyed by a person released on licence is precarious and conditional, the Court considers that an award of 6500 would adequately compensate Mr Faulkner [87].
Even where it is not established that an earlier hearing would have resulted in earlier release, there is a strong presumption that delay which violated Article 5(4) has caused the prisoner frustration and anxiety.
Where such a presumption is not rebutted, an award of damages should be made, though on a modest scale [53, 67 68].
No such award should be made in cases where the frustration and anxiety were insufficiently severe to warrant an award, although that is unlikely to be the case where the delay was of around three months or more [66].
Following that approach, and having regard to ECtHR authorities, the award of 300 to Mr Sturnham was reasonable in his case [97].
Lord Carnwath concurs with the reasoning and conclusions in Lord Reeds judgment, but suggests a more selective approach to ECtHR authorities.
He suggests focusing on those cases which explicitly decide points of principle, and eschewing those which are simply assessments of the facts [104 127].

uksc-2017-0053,"The Respondent, Mr Gary Smith, is a plumbing and heating engineer.
Between August 2005 and April 2011 Mr Smith worked for the First Appellant Pimlico Plumbers Ltd a substantial plumbing business in London which is owned by the Second Appellant, Mr Charlie Mullins.
Mr Smith had worked for the company under two written agreements (the second of which replaced the first in 2009).
These agreements were drafted in quite confusing terms.
In August 2011 Mr Smith issued proceedings against the Appellants before the employment tribunal alleging that he had been unfairly dismissed, that an unlawful deduction had been made from his wages, that he had not been paid for a period of statutory annual leave and that he had been discriminated against by virtue of his disability.
The employment tribunal decided that Mr Smith had not been an employee under a contract of employment, and therefore that he was not entitled to complain of unfair dismissal (a finding that Mr Smith does not now challenge), but that Mr Smith (i) was a worker within the meaning of s.230(3) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, (ii) was a worker within the meaning of regulation 2(1) of the Working Time Regulations 1998, and (iii) had been in employment for the purposes of s.83(2) of the Equality Act 2010.
These findings meant that Mr Smith could legitimately proceed with his latter three complaints and directions were made for their substantive consideration at a later date.
The Appellants appealed this decision to an appeal tribunal and then to the Court of Appeal, but were unsuccessful.
They consequently appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Wilson gives the judgment with which Lady Hale, Lord Hughes, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd Jones agree.
The tribunal was entitled to conclude that Mr Smith qualified as a worker under s.230(3)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (and by analogy the relevant provisions of the Working Time Regulations 1998 and the Equality Act 2010), and his substantive claims can proceed to be heard.
Conceptually, it is both legitimate and convenient to treat the three positive findings of the tribunal as having been founded upon a conclusion that Mr Smith was a worker within the meaning of s.230(3)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (otherwise known as a limb (b) worker) [15].
This was because regulation 2(1) of the Working Time Regulations defines worker in identical terms to s.230(3)(b), and case law has suggested that the meaning of employment in s.83(2) of the Equality Act is also essentially the same [12 15].
Proceeding on that basis, if Mr Smith was to qualify as a limb (b) worker under s.230(3)(b) then it was necessary for him to have undertaken to personally perform his work or services for Pimlico Plumbers, and that the company be neither his client nor his customer.
When considering whether Mr Smith had undertaken to provide a personal service, it was relevant that when working for Pimlico Mr Smith had a limited facility (not found in his written contracts) to appoint another Pimlico operative to do a job he had previously quoted for but no longer wished to undertake [24 5].
However, it is helpful to assess the significance of this right to substitute by considering whether the dominant feature of the contract remained personal performance on his part.
In this case the terms of the contract (which referred to your skills etc.) are clearly directed to performance by Mr Smith personally, and any right to substitute was significantly limited by the fact that the substitute had to come from the ranks of those bound to Pimlico in similar terms.
Consequently, the tribunal was entitled to hold that the dominant feature of Mr Smiths contract with the company was an obligation of personal performance [32 34].
On the issue of whether Pimlico Plumbers was a client or customer of Mr Smith, the tribunal had legitimately found that there was an umbrella contract between the parties, i.e. one which cast obligations on Mr Smith even when he was between assignments for Pimlico.
It was therefore not necessary to consider what impact a finding that there was no umbrella contract (and therefore that the contractual obligations subsisted only during the actual assignments) would have had on the limb (b) analysis [37, 41].
Instead, one had to look at the wording of the written contractual documents to determine whether Pimlico was a client or customer of Mr Smith.
On the one hand, Mr Smith was free to reject a particular offer of work, and was free to accept outside work if no work was offered by any of Pimlicos clients.
He also bore some of the financial risk of the work, and the manner in which he undertook it was not supervised by Pimlico.
However, there were also features of the contract which strongly militated against recognition of Pimlico as a client or customer of Mr Smith.
These included Pimlicos tight control over Mr Smiths attire and the administrative aspects of any job, the severe terms as to when and how much it was obliged to pay him, and the suite of covenants restricting his working activities following termination [47 48].
Accordingly, the tribunal was entitled to conclude that Pimlico cannot be regarded as a client or customer of Mr Smith [49].
",Gary Smith worked for Pimlico Plumbers Ltd between August 2005 and April 2011. He claimed he had been unfairly dismissed and discriminated against by virtue of his disability. The employment tribunal decided that Mr Smith had not been an employee under a contract of employment.

uksc-2016-0195,"The respondents to these appeals (Mrs Gallagher, P, G and W) have all been convicted or received cautions or reprimands in respect of relatively minor offending.
The disclosure of their criminal records to potential employers has made, or may in future make, it more difficult for them to obtain employment.
In each case, the relevant convictions and cautions were spent under the legislation designed for the rehabilitation of ex offenders, set out below.
Nonetheless, criminal records had to be disclosed if they applied for employment involving contact with children or vulnerable adults.
In 1996, Mrs Gallagher was convicted of one count of driving without wearing a seatbelt, for which she was fined 10, and three counts of carrying a child under fourteen years old without a seatbelt, for which she was fined 25 on each count.
In 1998, she was again convicted of two counts of the latter offence and fined 40 on each count.
Mrs Gallagher has no other convictions.
In 2013, having qualified as a social carer, she was admitted to the Northern Ireland Social Care Council Register of Social Care Workers.
In 2014, she applied for a permanent position at a day centre for adults with learning difficulties and received a conditional offer of employment.
On a disclosure request, she only disclosed the 1996 convictions regarding her children, but not the 1996 conviction as to herself, nor the 1998 convictions.
Her job offer was withdrawn after the Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate disclosed all her previous convictions.
In 1999, P received a caution for the theft of a sandwich from a shop.
In the same year, P was convicted of the theft of a book worth 99p and of failing to surrender to the bail granted to her after her arrest for that offence.
She received a conditional discharge for both offences.
At the time of the offences, P was 28 years old, homeless and suffering from undiagnosed schizophrenia which is now under control.
She has committed no further offences.
P is qualified to work as a teaching assistant but has not been able to find employment.
She believes this is the result of her disclosure obligations.
In 1982, W was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
He was 16 years old at the time when the assault occurred during a fight between a number of boys on their way home from school.
He received a conditional discharge, and has not offended since.
In 2013, aged 47, he began a course to obtain a certificate in teaching English to adults.
He believes that his chances of obtaining teaching employment will be prejudiced by the need to obtain a criminal record certificate for a job as a teacher.
In 2006, G, aged 13, was arrested for sexually assaulting two younger boys.
The offences involved sexual touching and attempted anal intercourse.
There was exceptional mitigation.
The police record indicates that the sexual activity was consensual and seems to have been in the form of dares and is
believed to have been a case of sexual curiosity and experimentation on the part of all three boys.
The Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to prosecute but suggested a reprimand.
G received two police reprimands in September 2006.
He has not offended since.
In 2011, when working as a library assistant in a local college, he was required to apply for an enhanced criminal record check because his work involved contact with children.
The police proposed to disclose the reprimand, with an account of the mitigation.
As a result, G withdrew the application and lost his job.
He has since felt unable to apply for any job requiring an enhanced criminal record check.
In all four of the appeals, the respondents challenge two related statutory disclosure schemes as being incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 (ECHR), protecting the right to respect for private and family life.
This raises two separate questions, namely whether any interference with Article 8 ECHR is: (1) in accordance with the law (the legality test) and (2) necessary in a democratic society (the proportionality test).
The first scheme, governing disclosure by the ex offender, is that under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (the 1974 Act) in England and Wales and the corresponding provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 (SI 1978/1908) in Northern Ireland, which are materially the same.
By sections 4(2) (3) of the 1974 Act, where a question is put to an ex offender about previous convictions, offences, conduct or circumstances, there is no duty of disclosure.
However, for any of thirteen specified purposes in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order (SI 1975/1023) (1975 Order) and the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Exceptions) Order (Northern Ireland) (SR(NI) 1979/195) (1979 Order), there is a duty of disclosure.
The second scheme, governing disclosure by the Disclosure and Barring Service in England and Wales or Access NI in Northern Ireland, is governed by Part V of the Police Act 1997, as amended (the 1997 Act).
Sections 113A and 113B deal with Criminal Record Certificates and Enhanced Criminal Record Certificates.
These provisions create a system of mandatory disclosure of all convictions and cautions on a persons record if the conditions for the issue of a certificate were satisfied.
In 2014, a more selective system for disclosure was introduced under the second scheme by the Disclosure and Barring Service the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Record Certificates: Relevant Matters) (Amendment) (England and Wales) Order (SI 2013/1200) and the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Record Certificates: Relevant Matters) (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order (SI 2014/100).
Broadly corresponding limitations were imposed in relation to the first scheme by the Rehabilitation Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (Amendment) (England and Wales) Order (SI 2013/1198) and the Rehabilitation Act 1974 (Exceptions) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) Order (SI 2014/27).
The Court of Appeal in England and in Northern Ireland (EWCA and NICA), affirming the decisions of the Divisional Court or High Court (except in Ws case), upheld the respondents case.
First, the statutory schemes were considered incompatible with Article 8 ECHR for failing the legality test because of the breadth of the categories in the legislation.
Secondly, the statutory schemes were considered disproportionate for failing to sufficiently distinguish between convictions and cautions of varying degrees of relevance.
The appellants now appeal to the Supreme Court.
Ps cross appeal concerns the refusal to quash article 2A(3)(c) of the 1975 Order for breach of Article 8 ECHR.
The Supreme Court dismisses the appeals (except in Ws case), but varies parts of the orders below.
A majority of the Court (Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwath, Lord Hughes and Lady Hale) reach that result based on a partial breach of the proportionality test.
Lord Sumption (with whom Lord Carnwath and Lord Hughes agree) gives the lead judgment.
Lady Hale (with whom Lord Carnwath also agrees) gives a concurring judgment.
On the cross appeal, the Court varies the order of the Divisional Court by adding a declaration that article 2A(3)(c) of the 1975 Order is incompatible with Article 8 ECHR.
Lord Kerr gives a separate judgment, disagreeing with the majoritys approach to the legality test and its application of the proportionality test.
Lord Kerr would have dismissed the appeals (including in Ws case) and affirmed the declarations of incompatibility made by the EWCA and NICA.
All members of the Supreme Court agree that Article 8 ECHR is engaged and that two conditions thus apply, namely satisfaction of: (1) the legality test and (2) the proportionality test [12], [73], [153].
They also all agree that the legality test requires, at least, accessibility and foreseeability [16], [73], [182].
Majority judgments (Lord Sumption and Lady Hale): Lord Sumption considers that the legality test, whether under Article 8 ECHR or otherwise, does not involve questions of degree [14].
For him, accessibility requires that it must be possible to discover what the provisions of a legal measure are, while foreseeability requires that a measure does not confer an unconstrained discretion [17], [31].
However, if the issue is how much discretion is too much (i.e. a question of degree), only the proportionality test can be used for review [17].
In the ECHR case law, in particular MM v United Kingdom (App. no. 24029/07), the Strasbourg Court has treated the need for safeguards as part of the foreseeability requirement and applied it as part of the legality test in cases where a discretionary power would otherwise be unconstrained and lack certainty of application [24].
There must be sufficient safeguards, exercised on known legal principles, against the arbitrary exercise of a discretion, so as to make its application reasonably foreseeable [31].
Lord Sumption disagrees with the EWCA and NICA as to the effect of the Supreme Courts decision in R (T) v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police [2014] UKSC 35, concerning the regime governing disclosure of criminal records in England before the changes introduced in March 2014 [15], [35 41].
He does not accept that R (T) decided that a measure may breach the legality test even where there is no relevant discretion and the relevant rules are precise and entirely clear [37].
For Lord Sumption, the rules governing the disclosure of criminal records under both the 1974 Act and the 1997 Act are highly prescriptive, mandatory and leave no discretion [42].
There is thus no real difficulty in assessing the proportionality of the two statutory schemes, so the legality test is satisfied both schemes are in accordance with the law for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR [42 45].
As to proportionality, Lord Sumption considers that two questions arise: (1) whether the legislation can legitimately require disclosure by reference to pre defined categories at all and (2), if so, whether the current boundaries of these categories are acceptable [46].
As to the first question, Lord Sumption considers that legislation by reference to pre defined categories is justified [50].
This is because: (1) the final decision about the relevance of a conviction should be that of the employer, who is best placed to assess the individual circumstances; (2) there is limited evidence that employers cannot be trusted to take an objective view; (3) the 1997 Act scheme is carefully aligned with the disclosure scheme under the 1974 Act, necessitating a category based approach; and (4) it would be impracticable to require a system of individual assessment [51 54].
On the second question, Lord Sumption considers that, with two exceptions, the carefully drawn categories in the legislation are not disproportionate [61 62].
The first exception is the multiple convictions rule, which does not achieve its purpose of indicating propensity as it applies irrespective of the nature, similarity, number or time intervals of offences [63].
The second exception concerns warnings and reprimands for younger offenders, the purpose of which is instructive and specifically designed to avoid damaging effects later in life through disclosure [64].
In Ps case, the disclosure was based on the multiple convictions rule under the 1997 Act, so the appeal against the declaration of incompatibility falls to be dismissed on that limited ground [65].
However, as to Ps cross appeal, article 2A(3)(c) of the 1975 Order is only to be declared incompatible with Article 8 ECHR (rather than quashed) [66].
As Mrs Gallaghers case also concerns the multiple convictions rule, she is also entitled to a declaration of incompatibility both as to the 1997 Act and the 1979 Order [67].
In Gs case, concerning a reprimand against a younger offender, the declaration of incompatibility as to the mandatory disclosure requirement under the 1997 Act is affirmed [68].
In Ws case, the High Courts order is restored since assault occasioning actual bodily harm may be a serious offence and it was appropriate to include it within the category of offences requiring disclosure [69].
Lady Hale agrees with Lord Sumption that, given the changes to the statutory schemes in 2014, the legality test is satisfied [72 73].
She considers that the law in question does not have to contain an individual review mechanism in every case.
The requirement is only that it is possible to test, both the
law itself and the decisions made under it, for proportionality [73].
The present schemes are not indiscriminate in nature and have been carefully devised to balance the competing public interests in (1) rehabilitation, (2) safeguarding and (3) practicability [75].
Given the need for a practicable and proportionate scheme, bright line rules are necessary [76 77].
She agrees with Lord Sumption that the categories used are proportionate, save as to the two exceptions above, and accordingly agrees with him on the disposal of each appeal and the cross appeal [78 79].
Lord Kerrs minority judgment: Lord Kerr would have dismissed the appeals (including in Ws case) and affirmed the declarations of incompatibility made by the EWCA and NICA.
Lord Kerr disagrees with the majority on compliance with the legality test and the proportionality test.
He illustrates the issues with the current statutory schemes by reference to a fuller account of the circumstances of each of the respondents [80 100].
He also reviews in detail the operation of the two statutory schemes before and after the 2014 amendments [101 146].
Lord Kerr considers that two important points follow from the Supreme Courts decision in R (T).
These are: (1) that there must be adequate safeguards built into a disclosure scheme which allow for a proper evaluation of proportionality and (2) that the provisions then in force were condemned for the lack of any mechanism for independent review [149].
Lord Kerr identifies five central precepts that are relevant to the legality test [153, 158], but adds that not all of these must necessarily be satisfied [159].
He considers that the fundamental requirement is that the operation of the safeguards must permit a proper assessment of the proportionality of the interference with the Article 8 ECHR right [159].
He also clarifies that his approach to the legality test goes beyond only satisfying the two requirements of accessibility and foreseeability, contrary to Lord Sumptions approach [182 187].
Lord Kerr would have found the scheme in England and Wales to fail the legality test since the cases show that there is at least the potential for widespread disproportionate outcomes in disclosure [162].
Therefore, it cannot be said that there are safeguards adequately to examine proportionality [162].
He suggests two potential modifications: (1) a provision which linked the relevance of the data to be disclosed to the nature of the employment sought [165 173] and (2) an individual review mechanism in some cases, such as that introduced in Northern Ireland in 2016 [174 175].
Further, Lord Kerr would have found the scheme disproportionate [188 190].

uksc-2013-0263,"Between 1954 and March 1959 Percy McDonald attended Battersea power station in the course of his employment as a lorry driver for a firm known as Building Research Station to collect pulverised fuel ash.
Between 1954 and January 1957 he was at the power station approximately twice a month but this fell to about twice every three months from January 1957.
While at the power station as a casual visitor Mr McDonald went into areas where asbestos dust was generated by lagging work.
The lagging work involved mixing asbestos powder with water in order to make a paste, as well as sawing preformed asbestos sections and stripping off old asbestos lagging.
Mr McDonald was diagnosed as suffering from mesothelioma in July 2012 and sadly died at the beginning of February 2014.
His widow, Edna McDonald, took his place as respondent in the appeal.
The National Grid Electricity Transmission Plc (National Grid) is the successor body to the occupiers of the power station.
At trial, Mr McDonald alleged that those occupiers had been in breach of their statutory obligations under regulation 2(a) of the Asbestos Industry Regulations 1931 (the 1931 Regulations) and section 47 of the Factories Act 1937 (the 1937 Act).
He also brought claims in negligence against the successors to his former employers and National Grid, but these claims were dropped before the matter came to the Supreme Court.
The trial judge dismissed all Mr McDonalds claims.
On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed Mr McDonalds appeal under the 1931 Regulations but dismissed his appeal under the 1937 Act.
National Grid appeals to the Supreme Court in the first appeal and Mr McDonalds representative cross appeals in the second appeal.
The Supreme Court dismisses National Grids appeal and dismisses the cross appeal.
On the appeal, the decision was by a majority of three (Lord Kerr gives the lead judgment and Lady Hale and Lord Clarke give concurring judgments) to two (Lord Reed, with whom Lord Neuberger agreed).
On the cross appeal, the decision was by a majority of four to one, with Lady Hale in the minority.
On the first appeal, the majority conclude that the 1931 Regulations apply to all factories and workshops processing asbestos, not just those dealing with asbestos in its raw, unprocessed condition.
The clear wording of the Regulations indicated this, focusing as they did on the processes in question rather than the nature of the industry. [27, 98, 116] The Secretary of State made these Regulations to
counteract the harm that could be done by the manipulation of asbestos rather than focusing on any particular setting where this might happen [96, 117].
The mixing of asbestos during lagging work at the power station fell within the meaning of paragraph (i) of the Preamble to the 1931 Regulations.
The Secretary of State was alive to the risk posed by mixing asbestos in settings other than a narrowly defined manufacturing context [49, 124].
Lady Hale points out that this interpretation of mixing was compatible with Cherry Tree Machine Co Ltd v Dawson sub nom Jeromson v Shell Tankers (UK) Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 101, which the Supreme Court unanimously approves in this case [100].
Lord Kerr holds that a worker in a factory or workshop where processing of asbestos took place was within the scope of the 1931 Regulations, even if not mixing asbestos himself or directly employed by the occupiers of the premises where asbestos was being mixed.
The Secretary of State made these Regulations under section 79 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 (the 1901 Act), which empowered him to afford protection to workers not involved in the asbestos processing.
The risk of injury which these Regulations sought to protect against arose from inhalation of dust or fumes.
There was therefore no logical reason to exclude those who were liable to exposure despite not working directly with asbestos [53].
Lady Hale concludes that liability under the 1901 Act is imposed on occupiers (rather than employers) to protect people in the premises they occupied, therefore the question was whether a person was employed in the power station, not whether he was employed by the occupier [103 104].
Lord Clarke deems that Mr McDonald was in a real sense working for the purposes of the power station and agrees with Lord Kerr [127].
Lord Reed, with whom Lord Neuberger agrees, undertakes an extensive review of the background to the 1931 Regulations.
They would dismiss the appeal on the grounds that the 1931 Regulations are not engaged as they are intended to apply solely to asbestos processing within the asbestos industry.
They hold that the Regulations were penal legislation which should be construed narrowly [158].
Lord Neuberger, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke and Lord Reed would dismiss the cross appeal.
They agree that, while the rest of the statutory criteria are met, there is no sufficient evidence to rebut the Court of Appeals conclusion that Mr McDonald had failed to establish that a substantial quantity of dust had been given off by the mixing process, as required by section 47(1) of the 1937 Act [90, 209].
Lady Hale would allow the cross appeal on the grounds that there is evidence upon which it could be determined that a substantial quantity of dust had been given off [108 109].

uksc-2013-0171,"The appellant (Melissa Menelaou) is the owner of a property, 2 Great Oak Court (the Property), bought by her parents in 2008 (in her name as a gift to her) as a family home for her, her siblings and her parents.
The respondent Bank had two charges, securing the parents borrowing, totalling about 2.2 million over the previous family home owned by the parents, which was sold.
The Bank agreed to release those charges, in return for a lump sum payment of 750,000 discharging part of the debt, and a fresh charge over the Property to secure the remaining indebtedness of 1.45 million.
This left 875,000 to be used out of the sale proceeds for the purchase of the Property in Melissas name.
Melissa was eventually registered as the proprietor of the Property, and the Bank as purported chargee.
Melissa only became aware of the existence of the charge in 2010.
She then discovered that the charge had not been properly executed and was in fact void, because she had not signed it and it had been altered without consulting her.
She sought rectification of the register.
The Bank invoked the unpaid vendors lien (namely the charge which the law gave to the vendor over the Property to secure the payment of the 875,000 which the purchasers were contractually due to pay him).
It counterclaimed that, because the 875,000 used to pay the vendor effectively originated from its release of the charges over the previous property, and was intended to be secured on the Property, the law entitled it to be subrogated to the unpaid vendors lien, and thereby to claim a charge over the Property in the sum of 875,000.
That counterclaim was the only issue at trial.
It was dismissed by the judge at first instance, but granted by the Court of Appeal.
The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.
Lord Clarke (with whom Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson agree) delivers the judgment.
Lord Neuberger writes a concurring judgment, with which Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson also agree.
Lord Carnwath writes a judgment dismissing the appeal, but on different reasoning.
This is a case of unjust enrichment.
Melissa was enriched.
The critical question is whether she was enriched at the expense of the Bank [19 22], because if so that enrichment was clearly unjust.
The answer is plainly yes: she became owner of the Property (subject to the charge) thanks to the Banks agreement to release a part of the debt in return for that charge.
Since the charge was void, the value of the Property to Melissa was considerably greater, at the expense of the Bank which was left without the security that was central to the overall scheme [24].
There was one overall scheme, and a sufficient causal connection between the Banks loss and Melissas benefit, adopting either a narrow approach (with exceptions) or broad approach to the causal test [25 35].
There are no other defences available to Melissa [36].
The appropriate equitable remedy is that the Bank is subrogated to the unpaid sellers lien.
This has the effect of reinstating Melissas liability under the charge, reversing her unjust enrichment, and allowing the Bank to enforce its equitable interest in the Property by sale [49].
Although this is a complex remedy, it has been rationalised by the development of the doctrine of unjust enrichment, and may now be applied flexibly to the facts of any particular case [37 48; 50].
Lord Neuberger agrees.
The Bank can establish an unjust enrichment claim against Melissa.
The first step is that she was enriched, because she received the freehold of the Property for nothing (or more accurately, received the freehold free of the intended charge) [62 64].
The second step is that Melissa was enriched at the Banks expense, both because the Bank could have prevented the purchase of the Property proceeding until it had been granted a charge, and because there was one overall scheme [65 68].
Thirdly, Melissas enrichment was unjust, since she (as a donee) could not be placed in a better position than her parents, who were not entitled to transfer the freehold free of the intended charge, and since she directly benefited from the scheme [69 73].
Fourthly, Melissa cannot point to any facts which give her a defence, even though she did not know of the charge and the Bank might have an alternative claim [73 77].
Lord Neuberger further notes that it is hard to identify a more appropriate remedy than subrogating the Bank to the lien over the freehold [79 82, 106].
The remedy is broad and flexible, and justified here on analysis of the decision of the House of Lords in Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd [1978] AC 95, 104 and Lord Hoffmans observations in Banque Financire de la Cit v Parc (Battersea) Ltd [1999] 1 AC 221 [83 93].
Melissas case is by contrast pure formalism [95, 99].
This remedy could probably also be justified on the basis that the Bank had a proprietary interest in the 875,000 used to purchase the Property, and that either the Bank or Melissas parents were the beneficial owners of that sum [100 104, 106].
Lord Carnwath concurs, reaching the same conclusion, but by strict application of the traditional rules of subrogation.
The proprietary restitutionary remedy is justified in this case by principles of tracing and subrogation as expressed in Boscawen v Bajwa [1996] 1 WLR 328, not because of any tenuous relationship with a vendors lien, said to subsist by way of analogy [109, 117 121].
The remedy requires that the claimant establish that its money was used to discharge the security through the process of tracing; the looser test of economic reality or simple causation (applied by the Court of Appeal in this case) is insufficient [132].
Here, there was a clear tracing link between the Bank and the money used to purchase the Property.
The Banks interest in the purchase money was clear and direct. [134 140].

uksc-2009-0166,"This appeal considers the scope of what is known in public procurement law as the Teckal exemption.
It considers whether a local authority was entitled to enter into contracts of insurance with a mutual insurer, established in co operation with other local authorities, without first putting those contracts out to tender in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (the UK Regulations) In 2006 and 2007 various London local authorities co operated and entered arrangements for mutual insurance.
The aim was to reduce the cost of insurance premiums, by removing the element of profit built in to an ordinary commercial insurance premium, and to increase the standard of risk management.
London Authorities Mutual Limited (LAML) was established in order to provide insurance to participating London authorities and their affiliates.
Brent London Borough Council (Brent) was one of ten authorities involved.
It became a member of LAML, made a payment in order to capitalise LAML and also provided a guarantee, undertaking to pay further sums to LAML on demand.
Once LAML was established, it contracted to provide Brent with insurance.
Brent did not conduct a tendering process for the award of the contract of insurance which it entered into with LAML.
Risk Management Partners (RMP), a commercial insurer, claimed that there should have been a tendering process complying with the UK Regulations and that, had one been carried out, it might have obtained the insurance which was placed with LAML.
RMP claimed damages from Brent.
Although that claim has now been settled, the Courts decision will determine other damages claims against various other London authorities and will clarify for the future whether the UK Regulations apply to contracts which a public body proposes to award to an organisation such as LAML.
The UK Regulations apply whenever a contracting authority seeks offers in relation to the award of certain public contracts.
They give effect in domestic law to an EU Directive, Council Directive 2004/18/EC on the co ordination of procedures for the award of public work contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (the Directive).
It applies to the award of public contracts.
Case law of the European Court of Justice has developed an exception, known as the Teckal exemption.
It provides that, in certain circumstances, the award of a contract by one public body to another separate legal person will not fall within the definition of public contract in the Directive, with the result that the Directive will not apply to it and EU law will not require the contract to be put out to tender.
The Teckal exemption comprises both a control test and a function test. (1) The local authority must exercise over the person to whom the contract is proposed to be awarded a control which is similar to that which it exercises over its own departments, and (2) that person must carry out the essential part of its activities with the controlling local authority or authorities.
This appeal concerned three questions of principle. (1) Does the Teckal exemption apply to the UK Regulations at all? (2) Does the Teckal exemption apply to contracts of insurance? (3) In order for the Teckal exemption to apply, must the control which the contracting authority exercises over the contractor be exercised by that authority individually or is it sufficient that it could be exercised collectively, together with other local authorities?
The High Court and the Court of Appeal held that the Teckal exemption did apply to the UK Regulations and that it was available in respect of contracts of insurance.
However, they concluded that the control test was not satisfied because LAML was too independent from the local authorities which made up its membership.
The claim between RMP and Brent having settled, Harrow was given permission to continue the appeal so as to have the issues of principle decided.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
It holds that the Teckal exemption does apply to the UK Regulations, that it is available in respect of insurance contracts and that it is sufficient for it to apply that the co operating public authorities together exercise collective control over the party to whom contracts are awarded.
The requirements of the Teckal exemption were satisfied.
Lord Hope and Lord Rodger both give judgments; Lord Walker, Lord Brown and Lord Dyson agree with both.
The Teckal exemption applies to the UK Regulations.
Although the definitions in the UK Regulations differ in some respects from the Directive, the purpose of the UK Regulations was to give effect in domestic law to the Directive.
There is nothing to indicate that the UK Regulations intended to depart from the European Court of Justices case law: [22] [26], [92].
The Teckal exemption is available in respect of contracts of insurance.
It did not matter that insurance was not a service that the local authority could provide for itself.
What matters is whether the arrangement satisfies the control test: [27] [30].
Both Lord Hope and Lord Rodger review the ECJ case law to consider the purpose and scope of the Teckal exemption.
The Directive is not intended to protect the commercial sector by forcing public authorities to obtain the services which they need on the commercial market.
Rather, its purpose is to ensure that, if public authorities do decide to obtain the services which they need from outside bodies, proper procedures are followed to ensure that potential providers have an opportunity to compete for the work.
The Directive therefore does not apply where a public authority obtains the product or services from its own resources.
Nor, in light of Teckal, does it apply where an authority obtains services from a separate body which is so closely connected with it that the authority should still be regarded as, in substance, obtaining the services in house.
There is no reason in principle to distinguish between a situation where the body from which services are obtained exists to serve the interests of a single local authority and where it exists to serve the interests of several local authorities: [67] [73].
The Teckal control test requires that the public authority exercise a power of decisive influence over both the strategic objectives and significant decisions of the other body: [40].
That need not be exercised individually.
It is sufficient that the public authority could exercise control over the contractor alone or together with other public authorities: [41], [45], [47] [49], [52], [80] [85].
There must be no private investment in the contractor: [53] & [75].
No injury will be caused to the policy objectives of the Directive if public authorities are allowed to participate in the collective procurement of goods and services, so long as no private interests are involved and they are acting solely in the public interest in the carrying out of their public service tasks: [53].
The argument that individual control is necessary is simply inconsistent with European Court of Justices thinking: [80].
Here, the participating local authorities did exercise collective control over LAML.
Meetings of LAMLs board were not validly constituted unless a majority of those present were directors representing a participating member.
Participating local authorities each had one vote at general meetings and retained a power to direct the board by special resolution.
The fact that a director could not participate in a board meeting which considered a claim by a member which he or she represented was a matter of detail: [57].
No private interests were involved.
The function test was also satisfied.
LAML existed only in order to serve the insurance needs of its members: [59]

uksc-2012-0010,"This appeal arises out of an action for damages for harassment and for an injunction to restrain its continuance.
The question at issue is in what circumstances can such an action be defended on the ground that the alleged harasser was engaged in the prevention or detection of crime.
Mr Willoughby was employed by one of Mr Hayess companies.
In 2002, the two men fell out.
In late 2003, Mr Willoughby embarked on a campaign against Mr Hayes centring on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion in relation to Mr Hayess management of his companies.
This took the form of sending numerous letters to the Official Receiver, the police and the Department of Trade and Industry.
These bodies investigated and found no basis in the allegations, but Mr Willoughby continued to press these bodies and made a series of intrusions into Mr Hayess private life.
The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (the Act) makes harassment a civil wrong and a criminal offence, but under s.1(3) of the Act it is a defence for a person to show (a) that it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting a crime; (b) that it was pursued under any enactment or rule of law, or (c) that in the particular circumstances, the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable.
The trial judge found that Mr Willougbys conduct constituted harassment under s.1(1) of the Act but that he had a defence under s.1(3)(a) because he genuinely believed in the allegations involving Mr Hayes and wished to persist in investigating them.
The Court of Appeal allowed Mr Hayess appeal on two main grounds: (1) only the purpose of the conduct not the purpose of the alleged harasser was relevant, and in this case it was not reasonably or rationally connected to the prevention of crime; and (2) the prevention of crime had to be the sole purpose of the alleged harasser, and the intrusions on Mr Hayess privacy were not related to that purpose.
The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal by Mr Willoughby by a majority of four to one (Lord Reed Dissenting).
Lord Sumption gives the judgment of the Court.
There is no distinction between the purpose of the conduct and the purpose of the alleged harasser as such acts have no purpose other than that of their perpetrator.
The issue is by what standard that persons purpose is to be assessed [10].
A wholly objective test (adopted by the Respondent) is not consistent with the wording or purpose of the Act.
A test of reasonableness was not included in s.1(3)(a), as it was in other sections of the Act.
It would also render the general defence of reasonableness in s.1(3)(c) otiose [11].
A wholly subjective test (adopted by the Appellant) is equally problematic [12].
Those who claim to be acting for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime may,
at a purely subjective level, entertain views about what acts are crimes and what steps are calculated to prevent or detect them which have no relation to reality.
Mere existence of belief, however absurd, in the mind of the harasser that he is detecting or preventing a crime, cannot justify him persisting in a course of conduct which the law recognises as oppressive.
Some control mechanism is therefore required, even if it falls short of what is objectively reasonable [13].
The necessary control mechanism is to be found in the concept of rationality, familiar in public law but also increasingly significant in other areas, such as contractual discretions.
Rationality is different to reasonableness.
Reasonableness is an external, objective standard applied to the outcome of a persons thoughts or intentions.
A test of rationality only applies a minimum objective standard to the relevant persons mental processes.
It imports a notion of good faith in requiring some rational connection between the evidence and the ostensible reasons for the decision, and an absence of arbitrariness, capriciousness or reasoning so outrageous in its defiance of logical as to be perverse [14].
If the alleged harasser has rationally applied his mind to the material suggesting criminality and formed the view that the conduct said to constitute harassment was appropriate for its detection or prevention, the court will not test his conclusions by reference to what view a hypothetical reasonable man in his position would have formed.
If he has not done so but proceeds anyway, he acts irrationally.
He will not have a relevant purpose and there will be no causal connection between his purpose and the conduct constituting harassment.
Such a test would in any event apply to public authorities.
It is not a demanding test, and it is hard to imagine that Parliament could have intended anything less [15].
Applied to the facts, this tests means that after June 2007, Mr Willoughbys conduct against Mr Hayes was more than objectively unreasonable.
It was irrational.
He was no longer guided by any assessment of evidence, nor was there a rational connection between his supposed purpose and acts.
By persisting in pressing his allegations on the Official Receiver and other investigatory bodies long after they refused to deal with him, he was acting in way that was incapable of furthering the alleged purpose [16].
Although not strictly necessary to decide the point, it was also held that for the purpose of s.1(3)(a) the prevention or detection of crime need not be the sole purpose of the alleged harasser, but only the dominant one [17].
Lord Reed (dissenting) agrees that reasonableness is not required under s.1(3)(a), but rejects the idea that Parliament intended to impose a rationality requirement for three reasons: (1) Parliament did not provide for any rationality test. (2) A statute should not be construed as extending criminal liability beyond the limits which Parliament itself enacted it. (3) Criminal liability would turn on the subtle distinction between irrationality and unreasonableness, which could create particular difficulties in giving clear directions to juries [24 28].

uksc-2018-0011,"The appellants allege that they were abducted and mistreated by agents of foreign governments and then rendered to the Libyan authorities, by whom they were imprisoned and tortured.
They allege that this occurred with the involvement of Sir Mark Allen, who is said to have been a senior officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service.
After an investigation by the Metropolitan Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) declined to bring any prosecutions.
The DPP based her decision on a senior prosecutors decision and on legal advice that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute for any offence subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.
After an internal review by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) at the appellants request, another senior prosecutor reached the same decision.
The CPS declined to disclose the potential evidence to the appellants, citing its security marking.
In separate proceedings, the appellants have sued the British government for damages.
On 20 October 2016, the appellants issued the present proceedings in the High Court, seeking judicial review of the failure to prosecute Sir Mark Allen, who is alleged to have been the primary suspect in the investigation.
They argue, amongst other things, that the DPPs decision was inconsistent with the evidence.
The DPP argues that her decision was based on a review of documents which cannot be released to the appellants.
The Foreign Secretary applied to the court under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013 for a declaration that the judicial review proceedings were proceedings in which a closed material application may be made to the court.
A section 6 declaration is a prerequisite for an application to the Court for the use of closed material procedure under Part 82 of the Civil Procedure Rules, whereby the court may sit in private and without a party and his or her legal representative in order to prevent disclosures damaging to the interests of national security.
A section 6 application may be made only to a court seized of relevant civil proceedings, which are defined as not including proceedings in a criminal cause or matter.
The appellants resisted the section 6 application on the basis that these judicial review proceedings were in a criminal cause or matter.
The Divisional Court rejected that argument but certified the issue as one of public importance, suitable for consideration by the Supreme Court.
The proceedings were settled after argument before the Supreme Court, but the Court gives judgment in view of the importance of the legal issue.
The Supreme Court allows the appeal by a majority of three to two.
Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment, with which Lady Hale agrees.
Lord Mance gives a concurring judgment.
Lord Lloyd Jones gives a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Wilson agrees.
The adoption of closed material procedure requires specific statutory authority.
The Justice and Security Act 2013 gave the High Court a general statutory power, in certain circumstances, to receive closed material which is disclosed only to the court and to a special advocate.
As explained in the 2011 Justice and Security Green Paper, the Act was a response to a growing number of civil claims for damages against which the government was unable to defend at trial except through the unacceptably damaging disclosure of secret material.
Those claims instead had to be settled [6 7].
The ordinary and natural meaning of proceedings in a criminal cause or matter includes proceedings by way of judicial review of a decision made in a criminal cause, and nothing in the context or purpose of the legislation suggests a different meaning.
In English criminal procedure many decisions made in ongoing or prospective criminal proceedings are subject to judicial review in the High Court.
Judicial review therefore cannot be regarded as an inherently civil proceeding.
It is an integral part of the criminal justice system [15 16].
Judicial interpretations of the phrase criminal cause or matter in the Judicature Acts primarily reflected the natural meaning of the words, rather than any special feature of the Acts.
A cause is a proceeding, civil or criminal, actual or prospective, before a court.
A matter is something wider, namely a particular legal subject matter, although arising in a different proceeding.
The appellants application is an attempt to require the DPP to prosecute Sir Mark Allen.
That is just as much a criminal matter as the original decision not to bring a prosecution.
Parliament is unlikely to have intended to distinguish between different procedures having the same criminal subject matter and being part of the same criminal process; but the draftsman could have done so easily, for example by omitting the reference to a matter [17 20].
The Green Paper indicates that the distinction between criminal and civil proceedings in section 6 reflected the greater degree of control exercisable by the government in criminal cases, in which the prosecution can: (i) chose the material on which it relies, (ii) seek to limit the disclosure of unused material on the grounds of public interest immunity; and (iii) withdraw the prosecution.
That rationale does not require closed material procedure to be available in an ancillary judicial review of a decision made as an integral part of the criminal justice process, when it would not be available for an actual criminal trial [22 24].
Lord Mance agrees that the appeal should be allowed, essentially for the same reasons as Lord Sumption [25 37].
Lord Lloyd Jones, with whom Lord Wilson agrees, would have dismissed the appeal.
He concludes that the natural meaning and use of the word cause is appropriate to cover criminal proceedings which will result in a criminal conviction or acquittal, and that the word matter may extend beyond that to ancillary applications in such criminal proceedings (such as disclosure applications and extradition proceedings).
They do not, however, naturally include this judicial review, which is a public law challenge extraneous to the criminal process.
It is permissible to refer to the Green Paper in order to discern the purpose of the exclusion of proceedings in a criminal cause or matter from closed material procedure.
The core concern behind the exclusion is to ensure that closed material procedure is unavailable where criminal guilt is being decided.
These proceedings do not fall within the purpose of the exclusion [52 57].

uksc-2009-0143,"Sigma Finance Corporation is a structured investment vehicle (SIV) established to invest in certain types of asset backed securities and other financial instruments.
Sigma aimed to profit from the difference between the cost of funding its activities and the returns made on its investment portfolio.
However, the impact on the financial markets stemming from the sub prime mortgage market in the United States has meant that Sigmas available assets now fall very far short of the amount needed to pay even the secured creditors of the SIV.
All of Sigmas assets are secured under a security trust deed (STD) in favour of those of its creditors investing in and through Sigma.
The dispute in this case is between various classes of creditors as to the correct application of the STD where Sigma has insufficient funds to satisfy all its creditors and had failed to meet a margin call.
The STD provided that in that event there should be a 60 day realisation period during which the trustees should use Sigmas assets to create, so far as possible, two pools of funds relating to its short and long term liabilities.
But clause 7.6 of the STD also provided that: During the Realisation Period the Security Trustee shall so far as possible discharge on the due dates therefor any Short Term Liabilities falling due for payment during such period, using cash or other realisable or maturing Assets of the Issuer.
The Court of Appeal, by a majority, construed clause 7.6 as meaning that the remaining assets fall to be distributed preferentially to the creditors whose debts fall due during the realisation period, with distribution to be made according to the dates when payment became due.
The Supreme Court by a majority of four to one allowed the appeal by other creditors whose debts fell due after the realisation period.
The principal judgment was delivered by Lord Mance, with whom Lords Hope, Scott and Collins agreed.
Lord Walker dissented for the reasons outlined below).
The principles of contractual construction to be applied were well established and required consideration of the basic scheme of the STD.
Clause 7.6 appeared in the STD in the context of an assumption that Sigma would retain sufficient assets to cover its secured creditors.
It was not intended to deal with a situation requiring the application of priorities between creditors.
was improbable that clause 7.6 could be read as extracting from the short term pool debts which fell due during the 60 day realisation period so as to give priority over other creditors. (Paras [9] [10], [12], [13] [17]) It was also improbable that the parties would have contemplated priorities being conferred by the fortuitous timing of debts falling due during the realisation period.
Clause 7.6 was an ancillary provision which did not override the trustees absolute discretion as to the manner in which assets were to be realised.
No provision would have been made for the fees of the trustee if the Court of Appeal were correct.
The reasonable persons understanding of clause 7.6 was aided by a clear basic scheme that debts arising during the realisation period were to be part of the short term pool of creditors with the assets to be distributed equitably amongst all the creditors at the discretion of the trustee. (Paras [21] [22], [25], [32] [33]) Lord Collins added that textual analysis of the type used to interpret tax legislation was not appropriate to a commercial contract.
Detailed semantic analysis must give way to common sense. (Paras [35] [38]) Lord Walker dissented.
He found that on closer examination the case involved no issue of general public importance.
The legal principles were not disputed and the Court should avoid making new contracts for experienced commercial parties. (Paras [42] [46])

uksc-2015-0044,"Wang Yam was charged with the murder of Allen Chappellow and associated offences in 2007.
He denied the murder charge and alleged that he had been given the deceaseds cheques, credit cards and banking information by various gangsters.
The Crown applied for an order that part of the trial relating to evidence which Wang Yam wished to submit in his defence take place in camera (i.e. in a closed court) in the interests of national security and to protect the identity of a witness or other person.
This order was granted in January 2008 by Ouseley J.
At trial, because of the Wang Yams difficulty in keeping distinct the sensitive and non sensitive aspects of his evidence, the entire defence case was heard in camera in the presence of Wang Yam and his representatives.
In January 2009 Wang Yam was convicted of murder and burglary and sentenced to life imprisonment.
In April 2011 Wang Yam lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) against the UK, complaining that his trial and conviction were unfair and therefore violated article 6.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
The UK submitted that the application should be declared manifestly ill founded and inadmissible, or alternatively dismissed on the merits.
Wang Yam argued that he should be permitted to refer to the in camera material in his response to the UKs observations before the ECtHR.
In February 2014 Ouseley J ruled that Wang Yam should not be able to disclose the in camera material to the ECtHR.
Wang Yam applied for and was granted judicial review of that decision, but the application was dismissed on its merits.
The Divisional Court allowed a leapfrog appeal direct to the Supreme Court on the following questions: Is there a power to prevent an individual from placing material before the European Court of Human Rights? If so, can the power be exercised where the domestic court is satisfied that it is not in the interests of state for the material to be made public even to the Strasbourg court?
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Wang Yams appeal.
Lord Mance gives the judgment of the Court.
In a purely domestic context the English courts have a discretion to refuse to permit disclosure of material deployed in camera.
The issue before the Supreme Court is whether this power ceases to be
exercisable once an applicant to the ECtHR decides that he wishes to disclose the material to that court in the context of a complaint that the in camera proceedings made his trial unfair [1 2].
Wang Yams case depends on the proposition that the courts below have discretion to prevent the disclosure of in camera material to the ECtHR [20].
This proposition depends in turn on the submission that such discretion would involve the UK in a breach of the international obligations under article 34 ECHR, which provides that: The Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto.
The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.
Refusal to permit disclosure to the ECtHR does not constitute a breach of international law [22, 24 34].
The English courts have repeatedly found that it was both necessary and fair to hold part of the trial in camera.
The in camera material formed part of Wang Yams own defence and has been seen by both him and his legal representatives.
The suggestion that its publication would have advanced this defence has been rejected as implausible.
If any court is to reach the conclusion that the UK is in breach of article 34 it must be the ECtHR and not the English courts [25].
On Wang Yams case he would be the sole judge of what is necessary at this stage for the effective presentation of his case to the ECtHR.
Wang Yam relied on article 34, rather than article 38 ECHR, which provides that: The Court shall examine the case together with the representatives of the parties and, if need be, undertake an investigation, for the effective conduct of which the High Contracting Parties concerned shall furnish all necessary facilities.
The ECtHR is able to decide under article 38 whether any further material should be requested from the UK to enable it to consider Wang Yams case [27].
The case law of the ECtHR indicates that it will not act as a fourth instance appeal court re determining issues of national security, but rather it will review the domestic adjudication on the issues involved and, if satisfied of its fairness and thoroughness, may accept the outcome without insisting on automatic disclosure to itself of secret material [28 33].
This reason alone is sufficient to dismiss the appeal [34].
Even if refusal to permit disclosure to the ECtHR breached an international obligation, English courts would not be obliged automatically to give effect to such obligation.
The UK takes a dualist approach to international law.
The starting point when considering a general discretionary common law power is that domestic and international law considerations are separate.
The decision maker may take international law obligations into account but is not bound to do so [35].
In R (Hurst) v London Northern District Coroner [2007] 2 AC 189 even the minority who suggested that a domestic decision maker should at least give consideration to international rights which can properly be regarded as fundamental went no further.
In any event, given that an appeal lies to the ECtHR under article 38 ECHR, any obligation on the UK at this stage under article 34 could not be regarded as fundamental [36].
In this context, Ouseley J took an orthodox approach to his general discretion and therefore the appeal must also fail on the second ground [37 38].

uksc-2014-0158,"In 2006, BNP granted to Marks & Spencer (M&S) sub underleases of four different floors in a building known as The Point in Paddington Basin, London W2 from 25 January 2006 to 2 February 2018.
Any difference between the sub underleases is irrelevant for the purposes of the appeal, so it is only necessary to refer to one of them (the Lease).
Under the Lease, the rent payable comprised a basic rent of 919,800 plus VAT which was payable yearly and proportionately for any part of a year by equal quarterly instalments in advance on the usual quarter days, and a car park licence fee of 6,000 per annum also payable by equal quarterly instalments in advance.
The Lease also provided for the landlord to recover, by way of rent, (i) a fair proportion of the costs of insuring the building and (ii) a service charge in respect of services provided to the building.
Clause 8 entitled M&S to determine the Lease on 24 January 2012 by giving BNP six months prior written notice (a break notice).
A break notice would only have effect to determine the Lease on 24 January 2012 if: (i) there were no arrears of rent on that date (clause 8.3); and (ii) M&S paid BNP the sum of 919,800 plus VAT (clause 8.4).
On 7 July 2011, M&S served a break notice on BNP.
Shortly before 25 December 2011, M&S paid BNP the basic rent due on that date for the period from 25 December 2011 up to and including 24 March 2012.
On or about 18 January 2012, M&S paid BNP 919,800 plus VAT.
As a result of these payments, the break notice was effective and the lease determined on 24 January 2012.
M&S subsequently brought a claim for the return of the apportioned basic rent in respect of the period from 25 January to 24 March 2012, contending that there should be implied into the Lease a term that, if the tenant exercised the right to determine the Lease on 24 January 2012, it should be entitled to a refund from the landlord of the proportion of the basic rent paid in respect of the period from the date of determination up to and including 24 March 2012.
Similar claims were made by M&S in respect of the car park licence fee, the insurance rent and the service charge.
The High Court held that M&S was so entitled.
The Court of Appeal subsequently allowed BNPs appeal.
M&S appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses M&Ss appeal.
Lord Neuberger writes the leading judgment, with which Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge agree.
Lord Carnwath and Lord Clarke both write concurring judgments.
The test for implication of contractual terms The judicial approach to the implication of contractual terms represents a clear, consistent and principled approach [21].
A term will only be implied if it satisfies the test of business necessity or it is so obvious that it goes without saying [17 18]; it will be a rare case where only one of those two requirements are met [21].
The implication of a term is not critically dependent on proof of the actual intention of the parties.
If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is concerned with the hypothetical answer of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time they were contracting [21].
It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for implying a term that it appears fair or that one considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them [21].
The judgment of Lord Hoffmann in Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom [2009] 1 WLR 1988 did not dilute the test for the implication of contractual terms [24, 57 74, 75 77].
Application to the facts It is well established that rent, whether payable in arrear or advance, is not apportionable in time in common law [44].
Section 2 of the Apportionment Act 1870 provides that all rents and other periodical payments should be considered as accruing from day to day and be apportionable in respect of time accordingly [44].
There is no doubt that section 2 applies to rent payable in arrear [45].
The conclusion of the Court of Appeal in Ellis v Rowbotham [1900] 1 QB 740 that the 1870 Act did not apply to rent payable in advance, is correct [45 46].
This mirrors the position on a forfeiture, where a landlord who forfeits a lease under which the rent is payable in advance is entitled to the payment of the whole of the rent which fell due on the quarter day preceding the forfeiture [48].
Given the clear, general understanding that neither the common law nor statute apportion rent payable in advance on a time basis, it would be wrong, save in a very clear case, to attribute to a landlord and a tenant, particularly where they have entered into a full and professionally drafted lease, an intention that the tenant should receive back an apportioned part of rent payable and paid in advance [47, 51].
M&S argued that, had it paid the sum of 919,800 plus VAT due under clause 8.4 before 25 December 2011, it would have been known at that date that the lease would come to an end before 25 March 2012 and thus BNP would only have been due an appropriate portion of the basic rent on 25 December 2011, and that commercial common sense therefore mandated that it should be in the same position whether it paid the 919,800 plus VAT before or after 25 December 2011 [35 36].
This argument is rejected.
Any anomaly in the working of the lease does not establish that the contract is unworkable or that the result is commercially or otherwise absurd [52].
The same conclusion applies to the car park licence fee and the insurance rent, but not to the service charge, in respect of which there is specific provision which contemplates repayment [55].

uksc-2019-0145,"This appeal concerns a fathers application for an order for the immediate return of his daughter from England and Wales to Israel.
The issue raised is whether the Court of Appeal, having determined that such an order could not be granted under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (the Convention), was nonetheless entitled to grant it under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to make orders in relation to children (the inherent jurisdiction).
The childs parents are Israeli nationals who married in 2013.
She is their only child and is now aged almost three.
Her parents lived at first in Israel but moved to London in November 2018.
There the marriage broke down.
The father returned to Israel, but the mother refused to do so, and remained in London with the child.
The father applied under the Convention, which is set out in Schedule 1 to the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 (1985 Act), for a summary order for the childs immediate return to Israel.
The allegation underpinning his application was that, on 10 January 2019, when the marriage broke down, the mother had wrongfully retained the child in England.
The High Court granted the fathers application.
On appeal, the Court of Appeal ruled that it had not been open to the judge to make an order under the Convention and set his order aside.
It held that there had been no grounds for concluding that the mothers retention of the child in England had been wrongful, and so the Convention had not been engaged.
However, it then referred to passing observations made by the High Court judge to the effect that, if he had found that the child had been habitually resident in England, he would have reached the same decision to order the childs immediate return under the inherent jurisdiction as he had under the Convention.
Relying on those observations, the Court of Appeal made a summary order for the childs return under the inherent jurisdiction.
The mother appealed to the Supreme Court.
On 14 August 2019, the Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal and set aside the Court of Appeals order.
Owing to the urgency of the decision, a judgment giving reasons was not issued at that time.
Lord Wilson now gives the unanimous judgment of the court setting out its reasons.
The appeal raises two questions.
First, was the inherent jurisdiction available to the Court of Appeal in principle? Second, if so, was the exercise of it flawed? The answer to both questions is yes [2 3].
Inherent Jurisdiction Available The mother argued that the inherent jurisdiction had not been available to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that a summary order (i.e. an order made without a full, conventional, investigation) for the childs return outside the Convention could only have been made as a specific issue order under the Children Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) [26].
A specific issue order is an order made to decide a question connected with any aspect of parental responsibility for a child: had it been appropriate on the facts to make such an order here, it would have been open to the Court of Appeal to do so [27 28].
Before the introduction by the 1989 Act of specific issue orders, summary orders for the return of a child abroad could be made under the inherent jurisdiction [29 30].
Such orders continued to exist alongside orders under the Convention after it was introduced into domestic law by the 1985 Act, since differences between the inherent jurisdiction and the Convention mean that an order for a childs return may, in some circumstances, be required under the former, but not the latter, legal framework [31].
But did the 1989 Act do away with the inherent jurisdiction to order a childs return [32]? The mother argued that para 1.1 of Practice Direction 12D, supplementing the Family Procedure Rules 2010, showed that the 1989 Act did have that effect: for it instructs that the inherent jurisdiction should only be invoked where the issues cannot be resolved under the 1989 Act [33 36].
However, practice directions have no legal authority to the extent that they state the law incorrectly [37 38].
There is no statutory basis for the instruction in para 1.1, and the case law indicates that an order can be made under the inherent jurisdiction even where a specific issue order would also have been available [39 43].
Therefore the instruction in para 1.1 goes too far.
However, if an order is available by both routes and a party chooses to invoke the inherent jurisdiction, the judge will need to be persuaded early in the proceedings that that choice was reasonable [44].
Nor does the court accept the mothers argument that an application for a summary specific issue order requires a different inquiry from an analogous application under the inherent jurisdiction.
The same approach is required under both frameworks, as both are based on the principle that the childs welfare is paramount [45 50].
Exercise of Inherent Jurisdiction Flawed The Court of Appeal did not inquire into whether the childs welfare required a summary order for her return, as it considered that the High Court had made that determination and had not erred in doing so [51].
Yet the judge had not made a determination under the inherent jurisdiction [52].
Nor could his determination under the Convention stand as one under the inherent jurisdiction: for the Convention, unlike the inherent jurisdiction, is not based on the paramountcy of the childs welfare [53].
The fact that the father had not invoked the inherent jurisdiction did not prevent the Court of Appeal from making an order under it.
But it did place a duty on the Court of Appeal to ask whether the mother had had sufficient notice of its intention to use the inherent jurisdiction to allow her to seek to oppose it [54].
The Court of Appeal should also have considered eight further questions before making its order under the inherent jurisdiction, including whether the evidence before it was sufficiently up to date, and whether the High Court judge had made findings sufficient to justify the order [55 63].
Its failure to consider any of these questions is what led the Supreme Court to uphold the appeal [64].

uksc-2018-0166,"This appeal raises a question concerning the role of the Supreme Court in relation to the principles governing the award of costs in lower courts.
The Appellant, Mr Gourlay, is a prisoner serving a life sentence, the minimum term of which has expired.
In 2014, the Parole Board decided not to direct his release on licence and not to recommend his transfer to open prison conditions.
Mr Gourlay challenged those decisions on a claim for judicial review.
The Parole Board did not take part in the proceedings.
The High Court decided that the Parole Boards decision not to recommend Mr Gourlay for transfer to open conditions was unlawful.
Upon his success, Mr Gourlay applied for an order requiring the Parole Board to pay the costs he incurred in bringing his claim for judicial review.
The High Court decided not to make such an order, following the practice described in R (Davies) v Birmingham Deputy Coroner [2004] 1 WLR 2755 (Davies): that, if a court or tribunal adopts a neutral stance in proceedings in which its decision is challenged, it will not be liable for the costs of the claim, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
The Court of Appeal upheld the High Courts decision not to make an award of costs.
Mr Gourlay appealed to the Supreme Court.
He argued that the approach described in Davies is no longer correct, that it was wrongly treated by the Court of Appeal as a binding precedent, and that it does not apply to the Parole Board in any event.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Reed gives the sole judgment, with which the other Justices agree.
Section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 provides that the High Court and the Court of Appeal have discretion as to the award of costs, subject to the rules of court [21] [22].
The rules of court include the general rule that, if the court decides to make an order about costs, the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party [23].
The rules of court do not, however, set out a comprehensive code [24].
It is also important that the appellate courts establish principles upon which the courts
discretion as to the award of costs may, within the framework of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and the rules of court, be exercised [24].
Responsibility for the development of those principles falls principally upon the Court of Appeal [24].
Generally, such principles are matters of practice, rather than matters of law [24].
The Supreme Court will ordinarily be slow to intervene in matters of practice, including guidance given by the Court of Appeal as to the practice to be followed by lower courts in relation to the award of costs [36].
This is because the Supreme Court is generally less well placed to assess what changes in practice can appropriately be made [36].
The Supreme Court can intervene where there has been an error of law, but, bearing in mind the discretionary nature of decisions on costs, and the rarity of their raising any question of law of general public importance, appeals solely on costs are not ordinarily appropriate [36].
The counterpart of this restraint on the part of the Supreme Court is that the Court of Appeal must fulfil its primary responsibility for monitoring and controlling developments in practice [37].
In order to fulfil that responsibility, decisions on matters of practice should not be treated as binding precedents [37].
Otherwise, any departure from a previous decision could only be brought about by an appeal to the Supreme Court [37], and the Court of Appeal would be unable to respond flexibly to unusual situations, and reach a just result in each individual case [38].
Instead, it is appropriate for decisions of the Court of Appeal on matters of practice to be open to review by the Court of Appeal itself [39].
To avoid repeated arguments, potentially divergent decisions, and the attendant risk of inconsistency and incoherence, such decisions should be reviewed only where there is sufficient reason to do so: for example, where there has been a material change of circumstances [40].
In the present case, the High Court took full account of the arguments made on behalf of Mr Gourlay, and reached a decision which reflected established practice [44].
The question of whether the Parole Board falls within the scope of the practice described in Davies is itself a matter of practice: it is not determined abstractly or on the basis of definitions used for other purposes, such as the meaning given to the expression court or tribunal in the European Convention on Human Rights [44].
There is nothing in the Judges reasoning which was erroneous in law, or with which the Supreme Court would consider it appropriate to interfere as a matter of practice [44].
The Court of Appeal also did not commit any error of law [45].
In particular, its approach was not inconsistent with the rules of court [46].
The choice of a judicial or quasi judicial body to take a neutral position in court proceedings accords with principles of judicial independence and impartiality, and this cannot be what the framers of the rules of court had in mind when they referred to an unsuccessful party [46].
In addition, the Court of Appeal correctly recognised that the fact that a party is in receipt of legal aid cannot affect the principles on which the discretion to award costs is normally exercised [47] [48].
It also did not incorrectly treat itself as bound, as a matter of precedent, to follow the decision in Davies [42], [45].
The Court of Appeal could have proceeded on the basis that there was no good reason to review its recent decisions on this issue [42], [45].
Nonetheless, the Court considered Mr Gourlays submissions in full and gave detailed reasons for rejecting them on their merits [42], [45].
Insofar as the decision whether to award costs against the Parole Board turns on matters of practice, it would not be appropriate for the Supreme Court to impose on the Court of Appeal its own assessment of the merits of the parties arguments [49].
Mr Gourlays appeal must therefore be dismissed [50].

uksc-2011-0128,"These appeals concern requests for extradition in the form of European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) issued, in the joined cases of HH and PH, by the Italian courts, and in the case of FK, a Polish court.
The issue in all three is whether extradition would be incompatible with the rights of the Appellants children to respect for private and family life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
HH is the mother and PH the father of three children: X aged 11, Y aged 8 and Z aged 3.
HH and PH are both British citizens, although HH was born and bred in Morocco.
In 2003 they were arrested in Italy and prosecuted on eight charges relating to the importation of cannabis into Italy from Morocco on various dates earlier that year.
After a month HH was released under house arrest.
She fled the country in July 2004.
PH spent a year in custody before being conditionally discharged whereupon he also fled.
They were later convicted of all charges although PH received a lesser sentence in respect of the eighth charge, that of conspiracy, because of his lesser degree of participation.
HHs EAW states that she has just over nine and a half years of her prison sentence to serve.
PPs states that he has eight years and four months to serve.
According to calculations made by PHs legal team, he is likely in fact to have only around four and a half years to serve.
Further, as primary carer for the children, were the family living in Italy he would be allowed to serve all but a few months of that at home.
PH has become the primary carer for the children because HH had experienced a collapse in her mental health.
There was expert evidence of the serious harm which would be suffered by the children if both their parents were extradited, in particular by Z who would be separated from her primary attachment figure The District Judge ordered extradition of both HH and PH.
Their appeals were dismissed by the Administrative Court on 11 May 2011.
FK and her husband are Polish and have five children aged 21, 17, 13, 8 and 3.
They have lived in the United Kingdom since 2002.
The two youngest children were born in this country.
FK is charged with offences of dishonesty with a total equivalent value of less than 6,000.
She fled Poland in 2002 and has not been tried or convicted of the alleged offences.
There was expert evidence of the serious harm which would be suffered, in particular by the two youngest children, if their mother was extradited.
The children had reacted badly to her arrest in 2010.
FKs husband is physically impaired and was found to display signs of psychological disturbance.
The Senior District Judge ordered extradition.
Her appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Court on 1 January 2012.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal in the case of FK.
The appeal in respect of HH is unanimously dismissed.
By a majority, the Court also dismisses PHs appeal, Lady Hale dissenting.
Lady Hale gives the lead judgment.
The application of article 8 of the ECHR in the context of extradition was considered by the Supreme Court in Norris v Government of the United States of America (No 2) [2010] UKSC 9, [2010] 2 AC 487.
The case concerned the effect on Mrs Norris of her husband of many years being extradited to face charges of conspiracy.
Whilst not involving the rights of children, the following principles can nonetheless usefully be drawn from that case [08].
First, there may be a closer analogy between extradition and the domestic criminal process than between extradition and deportation, but the court must still carefully examine the way in which it will interfere with family life.
Secondly, there is no test of exceptionality.
Third, the question is whether the interference with private and family life is outweighed by the public interest in extradition.
Fourthly, there is a constant and weighty public interest in extradition: people should stand trial and serve appropriate sentences for their crimes, the United Kingdom should honour its treaty obligations towards other States, and there should be no safe haven for fugitive offenders.
Fifthly, the public interest will always carry great weight but the weight does vary according to the nature and seriousness of the crimes involved.
Sixthly, delay in seeking extradition may diminish the public interest element and increase the impact on family life.
Lastly, as a result of the above it is likely that the public interest will outweigh the article 8 rights of the family unless the interference is exceptionally severe.
In ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, [2011] 2 AC 166 the Supreme Court considered the potential impact of Hs deportation on the article 8 rights of her two children, British citizens who had always lived here.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child required that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration (not, it should be noted, the primary consideration or the paramount consideration, [11]), although they can be outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations [15].
The approach of the court to article 8 rights is not radically different as between extradition and expulsion cases [29].
The countervailing public interest arguments may be different, in particular because extradition is an obligation owed by the requested state to the requesting state, but the balancing process involves asking the central question set out above.
In all cases there must be a careful analysis under article 8 of the potential effects of extradition [31, 32].
For guidance as to procedure in respect of gathering evidence, see [82 86].
In respect of FK, her extradition would have a severe effect on her two youngest children, who would lose their primary attachment figure.
That loss could have a lasting impact on their development.
Their father, though well intentioned, is unlikely to be able to fill that gap [44].
The alleged offences are not trivial but are of no great gravity [45].
There is no prosecutorial discretion in Poland and there has been considerable delay which may indicate the importance attached to her offending by the Polish authorities [46].
The public interest in extraditing FK does not justify the inevitable harm that it would cause to the lives of her children [48].
In the Italian case, the extradition of both parents would have a severe impact on the children.
However, having regard to the limited role of HH in the childrens lives and the central part she played in the very serious offences committed, the interference with the rights of the children is outweighed by the public interest in her extradition.
On this point all members of the Court agree.
As regards PH, the majority conclude that he ought to be extradited also.
Lord Judge notes that in the domestic sentencing context judges have for many years considered the effects of imprisonment on the children of offenders.
Unfortunately, the seriousness of the offences committed often means that innocent members of the offenders family will suffer as a result of their crimes [130, 131].
Given the nature of the crimes committed by PH, the public interest in extradition outweighs the interference with the rights of his children [135 138], a sentiment echoed by the majority: Lord Hope, [94]; Lord Brown, [96]; Lord Mance, [103]; Lord Kerr, [149]; and Lord Wilson at [170 172].
Lady Hale would have found that the current effect on the children and in particular the youngest is such that the extradition of their father in addition to their mother is not justified at present [79].
","These appeals concern requests for extradition in the form of European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) issued, in the cases of HH and PH, by the Italian courts, and in the case of FK, a Polish court. The issue in all three is whether extradition would be incompatible with the rights of the Appellants children to respect for private and family life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.",0.10294117647058823,0.101620029455081,0.10294117647058823,0.10294117647058823,2.6347144076665747e-08
uksc-2012-0126,"In May 2010 Mr Mark Irvine made requests under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (FOISA) to the appellant, South Lanarkshire Council (the Council), for information about the number (but not the identity) of its employees in a particular post at particular points on the Councils pay scales.
His purpose was to investigate whether the appellants pay gradings favoured work traditionally done by men.
The Council refused his request on the ground that to comply with it would contravene the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA).
Information is exempt from disclosure under the FOISA if it constitutes personal data under the DPA and disclosure would contravene any of the data protection principles in that act.
The DPA provides that personal data should not be processed unless at least one of the conditions set out in Schedule 2 is met.
The relevant condition, condition 6, would be satisfied if disclosure were necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Mr Irvine, except where it would be unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.
Mr Irvine complained to the respondent, the Scottish Information Commissioner (the Commissioner), who investigated and then held that the Council should disclose the information Mr Irvine sought.
The Council appealed against this ruling to the Inner House of the Court of Session, alleging in addition that the Commissioner acted in breach of natural justice by failing to disclose to the Council certain communications sought and received by him in the course of his investigation.
The appeal was dismissed and the Council pursued a further appeal on both issues to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
It holds that the Commissioner was entitled to reach his conclusion that disclosure of the information should be given by the Council to Mr Irvine, and that there had been no breach of the rules of natural justice when the Commissioner did not copy the correspondence to the Council.
Lady Hale gives the only judgment.
The right to the disclosure of information under the FOISA did not trump the provisions of the DPA, which continued to protect the right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data [6 7].
The conditions in Schedule 2 of the DPA applied to any kind of operation performed on personal
The word necessary was used in several of the conditions and likely to have the same meaning throughout.
Interpretation of this word had to be capable of applying equally well with each of the situations envisaged in the conditions, some of which involved compliance with legal obligations [8].
Condition 6 required three questions to be answered in relation to Mr Irvines request [18]: (i) Was Mr Irvine pursuing a legitimate interest or interests? (ii) Was the processing of the personal data necessary for the purposes of those interests? (iii) Was the processing unwarranted in this case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the employees? The European Court of Justice (ECJ) had confirmed that Council Directive 95/46/EC (to which the DPA gives effect in the United Kingdom), insofar as it governs the processing of personal data which is likely to infringe fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to privacy, should be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights.
National legislation which was incompatible with the right to privacy secured by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights would not satisfy the requirements of the Directive [20 22].
The concept of necessity had its own independent meaning, although the ECJ had not supplied a definition.
The Council argued on the appeal that there was a strict test of necessity and that questions of proportionality only came into other aspects of the conditions [23].
The Supreme Court agreed that the word necessary had to be considered in relation to the processing to which it relates, but condition 6 had a counterbalance with the rights and interests of the data subjects built into it and it might not matter where the proportionality requirements of Article 8(2) were considered as long as the overall result was compliant with them [25].
In this case, where the identity of the employees would not be revealed, it was difficult to see how there would be any interference with their rights to privacy and it was enough to apply condition 6 in its own terms [26].
It was well established in community law that, in the context of justification, necessary meant reasonably rather than absolutely or strictly necessary.
It formed part of the proportionality test and any measure which interfered with a right protected by community law must be the least restrictive for the achievement of a legitimate aim [27].
The Commissioner, in applying a proportionality approach to the meaning of necessary in condition 6, had adopted a test which was probably more favourable to the Council than was required and certainly no less favourable.
It was quite clear that he was entitled to reach the conclusion that he did [28].
On the second aspect of the appeal, it was common ground that the Commissioner had a duty to act fairly, especially as the sole finder of facts.
He was entitled to make his own inquiries and obliged to give notice to the public authority from which disclosure of information was being sought under the FOISA of any new material elicited by his inquiries which was adverse to its interests [29 31].
In this case the material contained in the correspondence generated by the Commissioners enquiries was already known to the Council and it was not a breach of the rules of natural justice for the Commissioner to refrain from copying it to the Council [32 33].

uksc-2018-0152,"The case concerns whether Zipvit, a trader selling vitamins and minerals by mail order, is entitled when accounting for VAT on its sales to make deductions of input VAT (the tax paid by the trader on goods and services purchased in connection with its business, as opposed to output VAT, which is the tax charged to the consumer by the trader on its goods or services) in respect of the price of postal services supplied to it by Royal Mail.
Under Royal Mails terms and conditions, Zipvit was required to pay the commercial price for the supply plus such amount of VAT (if any) as was chargeable.
At the time of supply, both Royal Mail and Zipvit understood that the supply was exempt from VAT, so Zipvit was only charged and only paid a sum equal to the commercial price for the supply.
Royal Mails invoices treated the supplies as exempt.
However, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) subsequently held that such a supply of individually negotiated mail services should in fact have been treated as standard rated for VAT.
If that had been appreciated at the time of the supplies, Royal Mail would have charged Zipvit VAT and would have accounted for this to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
The present proceedings are a test case in respect of supplies of services by Royal Mail where the same mistake was made.
Zipvit now claims that under article 168(a) of the Principal VAT Directive (2006/112/EC) (the Directive) it is entitled to deduct as input VAT the VAT due in respect of these supplies or a VAT element deemed by law to be included in the price paid to Royal Mail for each supply.
HMRC contend that on the proper interpretation of the Directive: (a) there was no VAT due or paid for the purposes of the Directive; and/or (b) since Zipvit at no point held invoices which showed that VAT was due and its amount, in compliance with article 226(9) and (10) of the Directive, Zipvit is not entitled to recover input tax.
Zipvit made claims to HMRC for the deduction of input VAT, which were rejected by HMRC.
Zipvit appealed against HMRCs decision to the First tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber), which dismissed the appeal.
Zipvit appealed to the Upper Tribunal (Tax Chamber), which dismissed the appeal.
The Court of Appeal dismissed Zipvits appeal from the Upper Tribunal.
Zipvit now appeals to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously decides that the legal position under the Directive is not clear.
It is common ground that at this stage in the process of the UKs withdrawal from the EU, in a case involving an issue of EU law which is unclear, the Supreme Court is obliged to refer that issue to the CJEU to obtain its advice on the point.
Therefore, the Supreme Court makes an order for a reference and sets
out the questions for the CJEU.
Lord Briggs and Lord Sales give the judgment, with which all other members of the Court agree.
Zipvit appealed on two issues: first, the due or paid issue, and second, the invoice issue.
The Court has decided that neither issue can be regarded as acte clair (so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt) and that a reference should be made to the CJEU.
The due or paid issue arises out of article 168(a) of the Directive, which provides that a trader who is a taxable person has an entitlement to deduct from VAT which he is liable to pay the VAT due or paidin respect of supplies to him of goods or services, carried out or to be carried out by another taxable person.
Zipvit contends that the commercial price it paid Royal Mail for the supplies of postal services must be treated as having contained an element of VAT, even though the invoice purported to say that the services were exempt from VAT.
Alternatively, even if this embedded element of VAT is not to be regarded as having been paid, it should be regarded as being due [26] [27].
HMRC contend that there is nothing in the Directive which requires or justifies retrospective re writing of the commercial arrangements between Royal Mail and Zipvit.
Royal Mail did not issue further invoices to demand payment of VAT, cannot be compelled to issue such further invoices, and has not accounted to HMRC for any VAT in respect of the services.
HMRC could not take action to compel Royal Mail to account for any VAT in respect of the supply of services.
As the courts below found, if Zipvit were to succeed it would gain an unmerited financial windfall at the expense of the taxpayer [31] [32].
On the invoice issue, Zipvit submits that CJEU case law indicates that there is an important difference between the substantive requirements to be satisfied for a claim for input tax and the formal requirements that apply in relation to such a claim.
The approach is strict for the substantive requirements, but departure from the formal requirements is permissible if alternative satisfactory evidence of the VAT which was paid or is due can be produced.
Zipvit contends that it has produced alternative satisfactory evidence of the VAT paid, in the form of payment of the embedded VAT [36] [38].
Against this, HMRC submit that the regime in the Directive requires particular importance to be attached to the requirement of the production of an invoice showing that VAT is due and in what amount.
A valid claim for the deduction of input tax cannot be made in the absence of a compliant VAT invoice [39] [40].
The Supreme Court refers four questions to the CJEU.
The first asks whether, in circumstances like those of Zipvit, the effect of the Directive is that the price actually paid by the trader is to be regarded as the combination of a net chargeable amount plus VAT thereon, thus allowing the trader to claim to deduct input tax under article 168(a) of the Directive in the amount of VAT which was in fact so paid by it in respect of that supply [42(1)].
The second asks whether, in those same circumstances, the trader can claim to deduct input tax under article 168(a) as VAT which was due in respect of that supply [42(2)].
The third asks whether, where a tax authority, the supplier, and the trader misinterpret European VAT legislation and treat a taxable supply as exempt, resulting in a non compliant VAT invoice which stated that no VAT was due, the trader is entitled to claim to deduct input tax under article 168(a) [42(3)].
Finally, in answering the prior three questions, the Court asks whether it is relevant to investigate whether the supplier (Royal Mail) would have a defence to any attempt by the tax authority to issue an assessment requiring it to account for a sum representing VAT in respect of the supply, and whether it is relevant that the trader (Zipvit) knew at the same time as the tax authority and the supplier that the supply was not in fact exempt, and could have offered to pay the VAT due, but omitted to do so [42(4)].

uksc-2013-0033,"This appeal concerns the application of the Cancellation of Contracts made in a Consumers Home Regulations 2008 (the 2008 Regulations).
The respondent, Mr Swift, owns a removal business.
The appellant, Dr Robertson, telephoned him on 27 July 2011 to ask for a quotation for moving his furniture from Weybridge to Exmouth on 2 August 2011.
Mr Swift visited his home the following day to inspect the items to be moved and while he was there the two men agreed a price of 7,595.40.
Mr Swift then sent a removal acceptance document by email, which Dr Robertson signed and handed to Mr Swift on his second visit to the house that day to deliver packing materials.
This document provided for charges in the event of cancellation of the contract less than 10 days before the removal was due to start.
Dr Robertson paid a deposit of 1,000.
Over the following days Dr Robertson made enquiries of other removal firms and found one which could undertake the work for 3,490.
He telephoned Mr Swift to tell him he wished to cancel the contract, and sent him a letter giving notice of cancellation on 1 August 2011.
He refused to pay the cancellation charges on the ground that he had been entitled to cancel the contract by virtue of the 2008 Regulations, and when Mr Swift issued proceedings, he denied liability and counterclaimed for the return of his deposit.
Dr Robertsons submissions failed at trial, and on appeal in the Exeter County Court, but the Court of Appeal found that the 2008 Regulations did apply in the circumstances of his case.
It held that they prevented Mr Swift from enforcing the contract against Dr Robertson.
However, Dr Robertson had not been entitled to cancel the contract because Mr Swift had failed to give him the required notice of his right to cancel.
The contract had remained alive and Dr Robertson could not therefore recover his deposit.
Dr Robertson appealed against the dismissal of his counterclaim to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows Dr Robertsons appeal.
It holds that the 2008 Regulations give consumers the right to cancel contracts made in their homes before and for 7 days after notice of the right to cancel is served, and Dr Robertson was therefore entitled to exercise this right and to recover the deposit he had paid.
Lord Kerr, with whom the other judges all agree, gives the only judgment.
The 2008 Regulations gave effect to Council Directive (85/577/EEC) (the Directive).
The Directive was designed to protect consumers against the risks inherent in the conclusion of contracts away from business premises.
It requires traders to give consumers written notice of their right to cancel the contract at the time the contract is concluded and asks member states to ensure through national legislation that appropriate consumer protection measures are put in place for cases where this notice is not given [8 12].
The Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that the 2008 Regulations applied in the circumstances of this case, and that the contract was therefore unenforceable by Mr Swift, even though there had been two visits to Dr Robertsons home at his express invitation.
It had been open to member states to adopt provisions that were more favourable to consumers than those required by the Directive [17 19].
The Court of Appeal had, however, erred when it found that Dr Robertson was not entitled to cancel the contract unless and until he had been served with notice of his right to cancel.
The 2008 Regulations should be interpreted in the light of the wording and purpose of the Directive [20 22, 28].
The right to cancel contracts made at home was central to the protection afforded to consumers under the Directive and the requirement to give notice of the right to cancel was not a technical prerequisite to the exercise of the right [23 24].
To hold that it could be nullified by a failure or refusal of a trader to give written notice of the right to cancel to a consumer would run directly counter to the overall purpose of the Directive and create a considerable gap in the level of protection provided [25].
Accordingly the cancellation period referred to in Regulation 2 (1) should be interpreted to mean the period commencing from when the trader is required to give the consumer a written notice of his right to cancel pursuant to regulation 7(2) and expiring 7 days after receipt by the consumer of a notice of the right to cancel [32].
On this basis Dr Robertson was within the cancellation period provided by the 2008 Regulations when he sent his letter of 1 August 2011 and he was entitled to recover his deposit [34].

uksc-2010-0240,"The appellants, all Algerian nationals, were suspected terrorists whom the Secretary of State proposed to deport to Algeria.
It was common ground that Algeria was a country where torture was systematically practised by state officials and no state official had ever been prosecuted for it.
The Secretary of State obtained assurances from the Algerian Government that the appellants rights not to be tortured or subjected to other ill treatment would be respected on return to Algeria.
The Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 established an appeal system which allows where necessary for closed material procedures and the appointment of special advocates.
If the Secretary of State wishes to adduce evidence which, for reasons of national security or other sufficient public interest reasons, cannot safely be communicated to the other party, SIACs rules and procedures provide for this to be done.
In this case, however, it was one of the appellants who wished to adduce evidence from a witness (W), who had inside knowledge of the position in Algeria and asserted that, notwithstanding the Algerian Governments official assurances, those in the appellants positions were in fact likely to be subjected on return to torture or other ill treatment.
W was prepared to give evidence in the appellants appeals to SIAC only on one unalterable condition: that his identity and evidence would by order remain absolutely and irrevocably confidential to SIAC and the parties to the appeals.
W was concerned that the Secretary of State might otherwise seek to communicate his evidence to the Algerian authorities, if only to assess its veracity and reliability, and that her doing so would place him and/or his family in peril.
The Secretary of State had two main objections to such an order being made.
First, she would be unable to participate effectively in the conduct of the appeals before SIAC, being unable to test either the validity of the reasons asserted by W in support of his claimed need for confidentiality or the substance of Ws evidence itself.
Secondly, the Secretary of State may find herself in possession of information pointing to the existence of a terrorist threat abroad or some other risk to national security, yet, bound by SIACs order, unable to alert the foreign state to the risk.
This could gravely imperil future diplomatic relations with foreign states.
The question in the appeals therefore was whether it was open to SIAC to make an order for an absolute and irreversible guarantee of total confidentiality in respect of Ws identity and evidence before the same were disclosed to the Secretary of State (in circumstances where it would nevertheless remain open to the Secretary of State to challenge the admissibility or weight of that evidence before SIAC in its determination of the substantive appeals).
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeals.
Lord Brown gives the leading judgment of the Court; Lord Dyson gives a concurring judgment.
The fundamental objection of the Secretary of State to the proposed order, based on her concerns about being obliged to withhold vital information relating to national security from a foreign state, thereby imperilling future diplomatic relations, is unpersuasive [11] [13].
It must surely be a substantial defence to any diplomatic complaint by a foreign state that the Secretary of State is subject to a final and absolute court order prohibiting her from acting differently [14].
A number of recent international instruments are replete with statements urging states to ensure that witnesses are protected against ill treatment or intimidation, particularly in a human rights context [15].
The imperative need here is to maximise SIACs chances of arriving at the correct decision on the issue before them concerning the safety of the appellants on return to Algeria and, therefore, for SIAC to obtain all such evidence as may contribute to this task [18].
Accordingly, it is open to SIAC to make absolute and irreversible ex parte orders of the kind sought in this case and on occasion it may be appropriate to do so [19].
The power to make such orders should however be used most sparingly [19].
Before making one of the proposed ex parte orders, SIAC should require the very fullest disclosure from the applicant (A) of (a) the proposed evidence from As proposed witness (W), (b) the particular circumstances in which W claims to fear reprisals, and (c) how A and his legal advisers came to hear about Ws proposed evidence and what if any steps they have taken to encourage W to give that evidence in the usual way subject to the usual steps generally taken to safeguard witnesses in such circumstances (e.g. anonymity orders and hearings in private) [20].
SIAC should only then, in the interests of justice, grant such an order if it (1) is satisfied that a witness can give evidence which appears to be capable of belief and which could be decisive or at least highly material on the issue of safety of return and (2) has no reason to doubt that the witness genuinely and reasonably fears that he and/or others close to him would face reprisals if his identity and the evidence that he is willing to give were disclosed to the relevant foreign state [34].
Notwithstanding the absolute and irreversible nature of the order, it should in addition be open to the Secretary of State, upon such order being made, to try to persuade SIAC either to seek from A and W a sufficient waiver of the ex parte order forbidding any further communication of the information, or, if such waiver proves unobtainable, to exclude or regard with additional scepticism the evidence submitted [21].
The Court, in permitting the making of such ex parte orders in the circumstances of this case, has in no way been influenced by the circumstances in which the Secretary of State is on occasion entitled to adduce evidence in closed proceedings divulged only to a special advocate and not to A. The scope of the orders sought here should not be regarded as levelling the playing field between the parties: the Secretary of State in cases before SIAC acts in the wider public interest and not as an interested party [22].
The same considerations and the same result would follow if the case engaging as it does here the rights of the appellants under article 3 of the ECHR raised a question under article 2 of the same.
However, if the ground on which an appellant is resisting deportation is an alleged risk of breach of some other article of the ECHR (e.g. article 8), the balance will almost certainly be struck the other way.
In those circumstances it would be inappropriate to make an ex parte order to protect the confidentiality of a witness [38].
",The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeals. Lord Brown gives the leading judgment of the Court; Lord Dyson gives a concurring judgment. The appeal was brought by a group of suspected terrorists who were to be deported to Algeria. The Secretary of State wanted to use evidence from a witness who had inside knowledge of the position in Algeria. But the witness wanted his identity and evidence to remain confidential.,0.10878661087866108,0.08046940486169323,0.07866108786610877,0.10711297071129708,1.777485804187345e-07
uksc-2012-0272,"This appeal concerns the circumstances in which an asylum seeker should be sent back to the country where he or she first claimed asylum if it is claimed that such a return would expose the asylum seeker to the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment, which is forbidden by article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
At this stage the appellants account of the risk that they face must be assumed to be true.
They are an Iranian national (EH) and three Eritrean nationals (EM, AE, and MA) who have come to the United Kingdom via Italy.
In each of their cases Italy is the country responsible for processing their asylum applications according to the relevant EU law, Council Regulation 343/2003 (commonly known as Dublin II).
The basis of EHs asylum claim is that he was tortured as a political prisoner in Iran.
He is now severely psychologically disturbed and needs treatment.
He claims that if he were returned to Italy he would be homeless and without treatment.
EM, AE, and MA were left homeless and destitute in Italy.
AE and MA, who are women, claim that they were repeatedly raped there, despite having been recognised as refugees.
MA has come to the UK with two of her children; a third was separated from the family during the attempt to make it here and has not been found.
AEs experiences have traumatised her, and she is suicidal at the thought of being taken back to Italy.
Italy is one of a list of countries which is presumed by the United Kingdom to be safe for returning asylum seekers.
The Home Secretary therefore must be satisfied that the appellants claims that they will be subject to degrading and inhuman treatment are not clearly unfounded if they are to be allowed to stay in the United Kingdom while they pursue their asylum applications.
That is important to the appellants because of the threats to their well being if they were returned to Italy.
The Home Secretary certified all of the appellants claims as clearly unfounded because Italy was not in systemic breach of its international obligations to treat asylum seekers with dignity.
The Court of Appeal considered that a systemic breach, rather than merely a breach, of those obligations was indeed required before the United Kingdom could decline to return an asylum seeker to Italy.
The Court of Appeal reached that conclusion on the basis of a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), NS (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department.
The CJEU is responsible for interpreting EU law, including Dublin II.
However, the Court of Appeal read the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) as requiring only a breach, rather than a systemic breach, of a persons human rights.
The ECtHR is responsible for interpreting the ECHR, and belongs to a separate legal system established by the Council of Europe.
By virtue of legislation in the UK, decisions of the CJEU are binding on UK courts, while decisions of the ECtHR need only be taken into account.
The Court of Appeal therefore felt bound to apply the CJEU case, as it understood it, over the ECtHR cases.
Since it held that Italy was not in systemic breach of its duties, it found for the Home Secretary.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the asylum seekers appeals and remits all four cases to the administrative court to determine on the facts whether in each case it is established that there is a real possibility that, if returned to Italy, the claimant would be subject to treatment in violation of the Convention.
The Court of Appeal was wrong to consider that only a systemic breach by the receiving country of its human rights obligations would justify not returning an asylum seeker to that country.
The CJEUs judgment in NS had to be read according to the context in which it was given.
While it did refer to a systemic breach, such a breach was well established on the cases facts.
The CJEUs focus was therefore not on the sort of breach that had to be established, but rather on EU member states awareness of such a breach.
There was therefore no warrant for concluding that CJEUs judgment was that there had to be a systemic breach; it only meant that a systemic breach would be enough.
The CJEU was not calling into question the well established test applied in human rights law, which is that the removal of a person from a member state of the Council of Europe to another country is forbidden, if it is shown that there is a real risk that the person transferred will suffer treatment contrary to article 3 of the ECHR [5658].
Indeed, the EU requires its laws to be interpreted in accordance with fundamental rights, such as those guaranteed by the ECHR.
And beyond that it is clear that the EU scheme of asylum law in general is to be applied in a way that respects the dignity of asylum seekers, and ensures a basic minimum standard of support.
Council Directive 2003/9/EC (commonly known as the Reception Directive) requires that member states provide asylum seekers with at least enough to sustain their health and ability to subsist.
And under Council Directive 2004/83/EC (the Qualification Directive), those granted refugee status are not to be discriminated against in terms of access to welfare support, accommodation, and so on [59 60].
These duties coalesce with the positive obligations on members of the Council of Europe who are also member states of the European Union.
Article 4 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights contains a human rights protection in equivalent language to article 3 of ECHR.
The UK, as an EU member state, is obliged to observe and promote the application of the Charter whenever implementing an instrument of EU law.
There was no dispute before this Court that the positive obligations under article 3 of ECHR include the duty to protect asylum seekers from deliberate harm by being exposed to living conditions (for which the state bears responsibility) which cause ill treatment.
And in R (Limbuela) v Secretary of State for the Home Department the House of Lords held that article 3 ECHR could be engaged where asylum seekers were by the deliberate action of the state, denied shelter, food or the most basic necessities of life [62].
Where, therefore, it can be shown that the conditions in which an asylum seeker will be required to live if returned under Dublin II are such that there is a real risk that he will be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, his or her removal to that state is forbidden.
The evidence about breaches of a positive obligation is more likely to concern systemic failings, but a focus on such failings is only by way of establishing that there is a real risk of a breach of article 3, rather than a distinct hurdle to be surmounted [63].

uksc-2014-0021,"Aspect Contracts (Asbestos) Limited (Aspect) contracted with Higgins Construction Plc (Higgins) to survey and report on a block of maisonettes which Higgins was considering redeveloping.
Aspects report was dated 27 April 2004.
During the redevelopment in 2005, Higgins discovered asbestos not identified in Aspects report and a dispute arose between the parties [1 2].
The contract contained an implied term (under sections 108 and 114 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, read with The Scheme for Construction Contracts (England and Wales) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998 No 649)) enabling disputes to be referred to adjudication [1].
Higgins referred the dispute to adjudication and claimed 822,482 plus interest for breach of Aspects contractual and/or tortious duties to exercise reasonable skill and care in carrying out the survey.
On 20 July 2009, the adjudicator found that Aspect had been in breach of such duties and awarded Higgins 490,627 plus interest.
Aspect duly paid Higgins 658,017 on 6 August 2009 [3].
It was also an implied term of the contract, under sections 108(3) of the 1996 Act and paragraph 23(2) of the 1998 Regulations, that the decision of the adjudicator is binding until the dispute is finally determined by legal proceedings, by arbitration or by agreement.
The parties did not agree to treat the adjudicators decision as final.
Higgins did not commence any proceedings to recover the 331,855 balance of its claims.
The limitation period for any such claim by Higgins expired in contract on or about 27 April 2010, and in tort by early 2011 [4].
On 3 April 2012 Aspect issued proceedings to recover the sum it had paid to Higgins, claiming that no payment had been due to Higgins on the merits of the original dispute.
Higgins then sought to counterclaim the 331,855 balance of its original claims.
Aspect responded that any such counterclaim became time barred after six years in 2010 or latest 2011.
The High Court (Akenhead J) rejected Aspects claim on the basis that there was no implied term for repayment and no entitlement to restitution after the expiry in 2010 or 2011 of a six year limitation period during which Aspect could have claimed a declaration of non liability with consequential relief.
The Court of Appeal allowed Aspects appeal on the basis that the contract contained an implied term for repayment by Higgins of any sum paid by Aspect which Aspect could show had not been due on the merits, and that this attracted a six year limitation period running from the date of Aspects payment.
The alternative restitutionary basis was not pursued by Aspect in the Court of Appeal.
Both courts held Higgins counterclaim for 331,855 to be time barred.
Permission having been granted to Higgins to appeal to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court invited submissions on restitution as well as on the implied term.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Higgins appeal in a judgment given by Lord Mance.
The Court concludes that: (1) Adjudication is intended to be a speedy provisional measure, pending final determination.
The decision of an adjudicator is binding from the time it is given, but lasts only until the dispute is finally determined by one of the ways identified in paragraph 23(2) of 1998 the Regulations or section 108 of the 1996 Act [14 15]. (2) Higgins argument that Aspects only claim was for declaratory relief and consequential orders and that such relief is time barred in the same way as Higgins own counterclaim is misconceived.
Consequential orders cannot be made for the repayment of money to which there is no independent basis for claiming [19 20]. (3) Aspect has an independent basis for having the original dispute finally determined, and for repayment, arising on an implied contractual or restitutionary basis.
That right arises upon and from Aspects payment [16 17].
It was an implied contractual term that Aspect, having made payment as ordered by the adjudicator, would have a directly enforceable right to recover such payment if, on a final determination on the merits of the original dispute, those sums were shown not to have been due to Higgins [23].
Repayment can also be claimed by way of restitution, it being retrospectively established by final determination that the sums paid pursuant to the adjudication amounted to an overpayment [24]. (4) The limitation periods for Aspects claims in contract and restitution are six years from the date of payment [21 22] and [25].
Aspect can require repayment by reference to a determination of the parties original rights and liabilities as they stood when they were adjudicated upon. (5) Higgins on the other hand is time barred from pursuing its counterclaim for the balance of its original claim.
This is the consequence of Higgins own decision not to commence legal proceedings to have the dispute finally determined within the limitation periods applicable to its claims [26 29 and 33]. (6) The Court of Appeals obiter observations in Walker Construction Ltd v Quayside Homes Ltd [2014] EWCA Civ 93, approving Akenhead Js decision in the present case, were wrong [34].

uksc-2011-0129,"These appeals concern requests for extradition in the form of European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) issued, in the joined cases of HH and PH, by the Italian courts, and in the case of FK, a Polish court.
The issue in all three is whether extradition would be incompatible with the rights of the Appellants children to respect for private and family life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
HH is the mother and PH the father of three children: X aged 11, Y aged 8 and Z aged 3.
HH and PH are both British citizens, although HH was born and bred in Morocco.
In 2003 they were arrested in Italy and prosecuted on eight charges relating to the importation of cannabis into Italy from Morocco on various dates earlier that year.
After a month HH was released under house arrest.
She fled the country in July 2004.
PH spent a year in custody before being conditionally discharged whereupon he also fled.
They were later convicted of all charges although PH received a lesser sentence in respect of the eighth charge, that of conspiracy, because of his lesser degree of participation.
HHs EAW states that she has just over nine and a half years of her prison sentence to serve.
PPs states that he has eight years and four months to serve.
According to calculations made by PHs legal team, he is likely in fact to have only around four and a half years to serve.
Further, as primary carer for the children, were the family living in Italy he would be allowed to serve all but a few months of that at home.
PH has become the primary carer for the children because HH had experienced a collapse in her mental health.
There was expert evidence of the serious harm which would be suffered by the children if both their parents were extradited, in particular by Z who would be separated from her primary attachment figure The District Judge ordered extradition of both HH and PH.
Their appeals were dismissed by the Administrative Court on 11 May 2011.
FK and her husband are Polish and have five children aged 21, 17, 13, 8 and 3.
They have lived in the United Kingdom since 2002.
The two youngest children were born in this country.
FK is charged with offences of dishonesty with a total equivalent value of less than 6,000.
She fled Poland in 2002 and has not been tried or convicted of the alleged offences.
There was expert evidence of the serious harm which would be suffered, in particular by the two youngest children, if their mother was extradited.
The children had reacted badly to her arrest in 2010.
FKs husband is physically impaired and was found to display signs of psychological disturbance.
The Senior District Judge ordered extradition.
Her appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Court on 1 January 2012.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal in the case of FK.
The appeal in respect of HH is unanimously dismissed.
By a majority, the Court also dismisses PHs appeal, Lady Hale dissenting.
Lady Hale gives the lead judgment.
The application of article 8 of the ECHR in the context of extradition was considered by the Supreme Court in Norris v Government of the United States of America (No 2) [2010] UKSC 9, [2010] 2 AC 487.
The case concerned the effect on Mrs Norris of her husband of many years being extradited to face charges of conspiracy.
Whilst not involving the rights of children, the following principles can nonetheless usefully be drawn from that case [08].
First, there may be a closer analogy between extradition and the domestic criminal process than between extradition and deportation, but the court must still carefully examine the way in which it will interfere with family life.
Secondly, there is no test of exceptionality.
Third, the question is whether the interference with private and family life is outweighed by the public interest in extradition.
Fourthly, there is a constant and weighty public interest in extradition: people should stand trial and serve appropriate sentences for their crimes, the United Kingdom should honour its treaty obligations towards other States, and there should be no safe haven for fugitive offenders.
Fifthly, the public interest will always carry great weight but the weight does vary according to the nature and seriousness of the crimes involved.
Sixthly, delay in seeking extradition may diminish the public interest element and increase the impact on family life.
Lastly, as a result of the above it is likely that the public interest will outweigh the article 8 rights of the family unless the interference is exceptionally severe.
In ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, [2011] 2 AC 166 the Supreme Court considered the potential impact of Hs deportation on the article 8 rights of her two children, British citizens who had always lived here.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child required that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration (not, it should be noted, the primary consideration or the paramount consideration, [11]), although they can be outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations [15].
The approach of the court to article 8 rights is not radically different as between extradition and expulsion cases [29].
The countervailing public interest arguments may be different, in particular because extradition is an obligation owed by the requested state to the requesting state, but the balancing process involves asking the central question set out above.
In all cases there must be a careful analysis under article 8 of the potential effects of extradition [31, 32].
For guidance as to procedure in respect of gathering evidence, see [82 86].
In respect of FK, her extradition would have a severe effect on her two youngest children, who would lose their primary attachment figure.
That loss could have a lasting impact on their development.
Their father, though well intentioned, is unlikely to be able to fill that gap [44].
The alleged offences are not trivial but are of no great gravity [45].
There is no prosecutorial discretion in Poland and there has been considerable delay which may indicate the importance attached to her offending by the Polish authorities [46].
The public interest in extraditing FK does not justify the inevitable harm that it would cause to the lives of her children [48].
In the Italian case, the extradition of both parents would have a severe impact on the children.
However, having regard to the limited role of HH in the childrens lives and the central part she played in the very serious offences committed, the interference with the rights of the children is outweighed by the public interest in her extradition.
On this point all members of the Court agree.
As regards PH, the majority conclude that he ought to be extradited also.
Lord Judge notes that in the domestic sentencing context judges have for many years considered the effects of imprisonment on the children of offenders.
Unfortunately, the seriousness of the offences committed often means that innocent members of the offenders family will suffer as a result of their crimes [130, 131].
Given the nature of the crimes committed by PH, the public interest in extradition outweighs the interference with the rights of his children [135 138], a sentiment echoed by the majority: Lord Hope, [94]; Lord Brown, [96]; Lord Mance, [103]; Lord Kerr, [149]; and Lord Wilson at [170 172].
Lady Hale would have found that the current effect on the children and in particular the youngest is such that the extradition of their father in addition to their mother is not justified at present [79].

uksc-2017-0074,"The issue in this appeal is when the notice period begins to run, if an employee is dismissed on written notice posted to his home address.
If the answer is not specified in the contract of employment, is it (i) when the letter would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post; (ii) when it was in fact delivered to that address; or (iii) when the letter comes to the attention of the employee and he has either read it or had a reasonable opportunity to do so? The respondent, Mrs Haywood, was dismissed by reason of redundancy by her employer, the appellant NHS Trust (the Trust).
Her contract of employment provided for termination on a minimum period of notice of 12 weeks but not how such notice should be given.
On 20 April 2011, the Trust sent a letter giving written notice of termination by recorded delivery to Mrs Haywoods home address.
The Trust was aware that she was away on holiday.
The letter was collected from the local sorting office by her father in law on 26 April 2011 and left by him in her house that day.
She returned from holiday abroad on 27 April 2011 and read the letter.
On the unusual facts of this case, the date on which the 12 week notice period started to run was highly material.
If it commenced on 27 April 2011, it expired on 20 July 2011, the date of Mrs Haywoods 50th birthday, and Mrs Haywood would be entitled to claim a non actuarially reduced early retirement pension.
The High Court and the Court of Appeal (by a majority) upheld Mrs Haywoods case that the notice period only commenced on 27 April 2011.
The Supreme Court by a majority of three to two (Lord Lloyd Jones and Lord Briggs dissenting) dismisses the Trusts appeal.
Lady Hale, with whom Lord Wilson and Lady Black agree, gives the main judgment and Lady Black adds a further analysis of the case law.
The dissenting judgment is given by Lord Briggs, with whom Lord Lloyd Jones agrees.
In the absence of an express contractual provision, the court had to determine the implied contractual term as to when a notice takes effect.
The Trust argued that there was a common law rule, principally
derived from landlord and tenant cases, which provided that notice was given when the letter was delivered to its address.
Mrs Haywood relied on the approach of the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in employment cases to support her case that notice only took effect when it had actually been received by the employee and the employee had either read or had a reasonable opportunity of reading it [12].
Having reviewed the cases relied on by the parties, the majority held that the approach which had been consistently taken by the EAT was correct because: The common law rule in non employment cases was not as clear and universal as suggested.
Receipt of the notice was always required, and arguably by a person authorised to receive it.
Even after a statutory presumption of receipt at the address was introduced, this was rebuttable.
The EAT was an expert tribunal familiar with employment practices, and with the general merits in employment cases.
Mrs Haywoods contract with the Trust was concluded when the EAT cases were thought to represent the general law.
There was no reason to suppose that this approach had caused any real difficulties in practice.
An employer could either make express alternative provision in the contract or ensure notice of termination was received in sufficient time to allow the employment to terminate on a specified day.
It was important for both employer and employee, even in dismissal on notice cases, to know whether and when the employment had come to an end.
The rule should be the same as for summary dismissal cases [39].
Lady Black, agreeing with this conclusion, reviewed the common law cases in further detail to support the finding that that these cases did not have the effect contended for by the Trust [41 75].
Insofar as any clear principle emerged, it revolved around delivery to the recipients agent, who might be a household servant, professional agent or family member, who would be expected to take in communications for the intended recipient as part of their role [73].
Lord Briggs, dissenting, would have found that the common law cases had long established a rule embedding an implied term into contracts of employment determinable on notice [78].
Such contracts were only a sub species of relationship contracts [79].
The rule for relationship contracts was that written notice of termination was given when the document containing it was duly delivered by hand or post to the address of the intended recipient, regardless of whether either the intended recipient or his agent was there to receive it [81, 100].
The rule had a sensible and even handed policy objective behind it, creating certainty for both parties and representing a fair allocation of risk [118 121].

uksc-2009-0172,"On 9 June 2005, Tullis Russell entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement) and related services agreement (the Service Agreement) with Inveresk for the acquisition of the property rights to the Gemini brand of paper.
To acquire these rights, Tullis Russell was to pay: (i) a fixed sum of 5 million as initial consideration; (ii) a sum of up to 2 million as additional consideration, depending upon the volume of products sold and invoiced by Tullis Russell between 8 November 2005 and 8 November 2006; and (iii) various payments under the Service Agreement.
To date, Tullis Russell has paid Inveresk 5 million as initial consideration under the Asset Purchase Agreement and 8 million under the Service Agreement.
The parties are now in dispute regarding various payments and sums in damages that are said to be due.
Inveresk claims that it is entitled to a further sum of 909,395 under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Tullis Russell claims that Inveresk breached the Asset Purchase Agreement and Service Agreement by failing to maintain required product quality standards and dealing with customers so as to damage the goodwill of the business.
It seeks 5,358,032.90 in damages.
Two issues arise in the appeal: Firstly, whether the additional consideration claimed by Inveresk has become due and payable under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Secondly, whether Tullis Russell is entitled to retain the sum it claims in damages, pending resolution of the claim, against any payment it is required to make to Inveresk.
The Court of Session held that the additional consideration sought by Inveresk was due and payable and that Tullis Russell had no right of retention.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal, holding that the additional consideration has not become due and payable pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and that a right of retention may in principle arise.
The matter is remitted to the commercial judge for further procedure.
Lord Hope delivered the leading judgment of the Court.
The Additional Consideration The operative provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement clearly direct that, having elected to exercise its right to require a tonnage audit, Inveresk is not entitled to change its position on this issue.
The terms of the agreement are perfectly intelligible, and the approach adopted accords with business sense.
The additional consideration does not become due and payable until the contractually required tonnage audit is completed [per Lord Hope, paras [21] [24]].
The matter is remitted to the commercial judge to determine how the conduct of the tonnage audit should proceed [per Lord Hope, para [25]; Lord Rodger, para [1]].
The Right of Retention A contractual right of retention can arise notwithstanding the fact that the relevant obligations are not recorded in a single agreement.
The critical question in determining whether a right of retention may apply is whether the relevant obligations can truly be said to be counterparts of one another [per Lord Hope, paras [35] [36]].
In the present case, the entire agreement clauses in both the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Service Agreement record the parties agreement that both documents form a single, indivisible transaction.
This is also emphasised by the recitals to the Service Agreement.
The agreements are expressly linked with each other.
The conclusion that they form part of a single transaction to which the principle of mutuality can apply is inescapable [per Lord Hope, paras [37] [38]; Lord Rodger, para [64]].
The Court of Session erred in concluding that the Asset Purchase Agreement and Service Agreement were not properly to be regarded as constituting two parts of a single transaction.
The guiding principle in such an assessment is that the unity of the overall transaction should be respected.
The analysis should commence form the starting point that all the obligations which the transaction embraces are to be regarded as mutual counterparts unless there is a clear indication to the contrary [per Lord Hope, para [42]].
While the current transaction did proceed in stages, it is unrealistic to suggest that these could be divided into a series of sub units or compartments.
The obligations undertaken by Inveresk were all inter related and served the same end.
This was to preserve the value of the intellectual property rights and other assets acquired by Tullis Russell as a result of the transaction.
Accordingly, Tullis Russells obligation to pay the initial and additional consideration are properly regarded as counterparts to Inveresks obligations under both the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Service Agreement [per Lord Hope, para [45]].
In the result, Tullis Russell are entitled to retain any additional consideration that becomes due pending the outcome of its claims for damages under the Asset Purchase Agreement and Service Agreement.
The matter is remitted to the commercial judge for further procedure [per Lord Hope, paras [46] [47]; Lord Rodger, para [65]].

uksc-2014-0247,"The appellant was employed as a home carer by the respondents.
Her work involved visiting clients in their homes and providing personal care.
On 18 December 2010, at around 8pm, she was required to visit an elderly lady.
There had been severe wintry conditions in central Scotland for several weeks, with snow and ice lying on the ground.
The appellant was driven to the house by a colleague, who parked her car close to a public footpath leading to the house.
The footpath was on a slope, and was covered with fresh snow overlying ice.
It had not been gritted or salted.
The appellant was wearing flat boots with ridged soles.
After taking a few steps, she slipped and fell, injuring her wrist.
The Lord Ordinary, relying on expert evidence, found the respondents liable for the appellants injury on the basis that they did not provide her with protective footwear.
The Lord Ordinarys decision was reversed by an Extra Division of the Inner House.
The appellants appeal to the Supreme Court concerned the admissibility of evidence given by the expert witness, and whether the respondents had been in breach of their statutory duties or negligent.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows Ms Kennedys appeal.
Lord Reed and Lord Hodge (with whom Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Toulson agree) give the judgment of the court.
Lord Reed and Lord Hodge provide guidance on the evidence of skilled witnesses under Scots law, addressing (i) admissibility [39 56]; (ii) the responsibilities of a partys legal team [57]; (iii) the courts policing of the performance of the experts duties [58 59]; and (iv) economy in litigation [60 61].
In the present case, the expert witness had experience and qualifications in health and safety [9].
His evidence on factual matters was relevant and admissible.
He had the necessary experience and qualifications to explain how anti slip attachments reduced the risk of slipping [62 63].
His evidence on health and safety practice was relevant [64].
Whilst some of his statements might appear to be inadmissible expressions of opinion on the respondents legal duties, an experienced judge could treat the statements as opinions as to health and safety practice, and make up his own mind on the legal questions [66].
The witnesss evidence provided a basis for the Lord Ordinary to determine whether the defenders had suitably and sufficiently evaluated the risks and identified the measures needed to protect health and safety [67].
The statutory case was based first on the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (the Management Regulations), which implement Directive 89/391/EEC (the Framework Directive), and under regulation 3(1) require a suitable and sufficient risk assessment to be carried out [85 89], and secondly on the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992 (the PPE
Regulations), which implement Directive 89/656/EEC (the PPE Directive), and under regulation 4(1) require suitable personal protective equipment to be provided to employees who may be exposed to a risk to their health or safety while at work except to the extent that such risk has been adequately controlled by other means which are equally or more effective [93 97].
The most logical way to approach the issues was through a consideration of the suitability and sufficiency of the risk assessment [89].
The appellant was exposed to a risk of slipping and falling on snow and ice which was obvious and was within the knowledge of the respondents, who had previous experience of home carers suffering such accidents each year.
The risk had been identified in a 2005 assessment, and risks of that general nature were also identified in a 2010 assessment [90].
No consideration had been given to the possibility of personal protective equipment.
The precautions taken, in the form of advice to wear appropriate footwear, did not specify what might be appropriate.
The Lord Ordinary was entitled to conclude that there had been a breach of regulation 3(1) of the Management Regulations [92].
The appellant was at work whilst she was travelling between the home of one client and that of another in order to provide them with care.
Contrary to the view of the Extra Division, the words while at work in regulation 4(1) of the PPE Regulations, and whilst they are at work in regulation 3(1) of the Management Regulations, mean that the employee must be exposed to the risk during the time when she is at work.
They do not refer to the cause of the risk [100].
The Directives encompass not only risks arising specifically from the nature of the activities which the worker carries out, but also risks arising from the natural environment to which the worker is exposed whilst at work [102].
The Lord Ordinary found that anti slip attachments were available which would have been suitable to reduce the risk of home carers slipping and falling on ice, and that the risk was not adequately controlled by other means which were equally or more effective.
He was therefore entitled to conclude that there had been a breach of regulation 4(1) of the PPE Regulations [106].
In relation to the common law case, it was a mistake to view the appellant as being in the same position as an ordinary member of the public.
She was required to visit clients in their homes in hazardous weather conditions, whether or not the roads and footpaths in question had been treated.
Her employers were able (and obliged by statute) to consider the risks to her safety and the means by which those risks could be reduced [108].
A reasonably prudent employer would conduct a risk assessment so as to take suitable precautions to avoid injury to its employees.
The duty to carry out a risk assessment was logically anterior to determining what precautions a reasonable employer would take to fulfil its common law duty of care [110].
The respondents were aware of a history of accidents each year and were aware that the consequences were potentially serious.
Those circumstances were sufficient to require an employer taking reasonable care for the safety of its employees to inquire into possible means of reducing the risk.
Upon such inquiry, or the carrying out of a proper risk assessment, on the evidence accepted by the Lord Ordinary the respondents would have learnt that attachments were available at a modest cost to reduce the risk, and had been used by other employers in a similar position.
The Lord Ordinary was entitled to conclude that the respondents were negligent in failing to provide the appellant with such attachments [112 113].
The Lord Ordinary made no express findings as to causation, other than that the appellant would have used attachments if they had been provided.
The concept of suitability, under regulation 4(1) of the PPE Regulations, contained a causal component: the equipment must adequately control the risk so far as was practicable.
A risk would not be adequately controlled unless injury was highly unlikely [118].
In the circumstances, it was reasonable to infer that the failure to provide the anti slip attachments caused or materially contributed to the accident [119].
","The appellant was employed as a home carer by the respondents. Her work involved visiting clients in their homes and providing personal care. On 18 December 2010, at around 8pm, she was required to visit an elderly lady. There had been severe wintry conditions in central Scotland for several weeks, with snow and ice lying on the ground. The footpath was on a slope, and was covered with fresh snow overlying ice. It had not been gritted or salted. The appellant was wearing flat boots with ridged soles.

uksc-2011-0003,"These appeals concern a little used provision in article 1F(c) of the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees.
This excludes from protection any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering thathe has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
Both appellants have been refused the grant of refugee status by the respondent on this ground.
Al Sirri is a citizen of Egypt who arrived in the UK in 1994.
The facts relied on for the refusal of his asylum claim included his possession of and contribution to books connected with Al Qaeda and other proscribed organisations and his alleged involvement in the murder of General Masoud in Afghanistan in 2001.
The issue raised by his case is whether all activities defined as terrorism by United Kingdom domestic law are for that reason acts falling within article 1F(c), or whether such activities must constitute a threat to international peace and security.
DD is a citizen of Afghanistan who came to the UK in 2007.
His claim for asylum was based on his fear of persecution as the brother of the leader of forces allied with the Taliban, who had fought against both the Afghan government and the UN mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
In his case the question is whether armed insurrection against not only the incumbent government but also a UN mandated force supporting that government falls within article 1F(c).
In both appeals the issue also arises as to what is meant by serious reasons for considering a person to be guilty of the act in question.
The appellants appealed against the respondents refusal to grant asylum.
On 18 March 2009 the Court of Appeal set aside the determination of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) in Al Sirris case and remitted it to be determined afresh omitting certain matters on which the respondent had sought to rely.
DD was initially successful in his appeals but the Court of Appeal remitted his case for reconsideration by the Upper Tribunal because the AIT had failed to consider DDs individual responsibility and whether he fell within article 1F(c).
Both appellants have nonetheless pursued an appeal to the Supreme Court in order to challenge the approach of the Court of Appeal to the interpretation of article 1F(c) in a number of respects.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses both appeals.
Both cases will now be remitted to the relevant tribunal for reconsideration in accordance with the orders of the Court of Appeal.
In the case of Al Sirri the guidance given to that tribunal should be in line with the judgment of the Supreme Court.
The judgment is given by Lady Hale and Lord Dyson, with whom the other justices agree.
The general approach to article 1F(c) Article 1F(c) should be interpreted restrictively and applied with caution.
There should be a high threshold defined by the gravity of the act in question, the manner in which the act is organised, its international objectives and its implications for international peace and security.
There should be serious reasons for considering that the person concerned bore individual responsibility for acts of that character [16].
International dimension It is clear that the phrase acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations must have an autonomous meaning and member states are not free to adopt their own definitions.
There is as yet no internationally agreed definition of terrorism.
It was appropriately cautious therefore to adopt paragraph 17 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Guidelines which provided that article 1F(c) was only triggered in extreme circumstances by activity which attacks the very basis of the international communitys co existence.
Such activity must have an international dimension.
Crimes capable of affecting international peace, security and peaceful relations between States, as well as serious and sustained violations of human rights would fall under this category [36 38].
It could be enough if one person plotted in one country to destabilise another.
The test was whether the resulting acts had the requisite serious effect upon international peace [40].
Armed insurrection against UN mandated forces DD had been engaged in fighting against ISAF in Afghanistan.
ISAF was an armed force under the lead command of individual nations authorised by the UN from 2001, and was distinct from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which was established in 2002 as a peacekeeping force.
Both ISAF and UNAMA had the same objective to maintain peace and security in Afghanistan.
DD argued that simple participation in an attack against UN mandated forces did not engage article 1F(c).
The Supreme Court agreed that the protection for ISAF against attack was not the same as for peacekeeping forces.
This was not however material to the issue under article 1F(c) which was to be judged under the same principle in paragraph 17 of the UNHCR Guidelines quoted above [66].
The fundamental aims and objectives of ISAF accorded with the purposes stated in the UN Charter and DD was seeking to frustrate that purpose [68].
Standard of proof This issue arose in acute form in Al Sirri.
Al Sirri had been indicted at the Old Bailey in relation to the murder of General Masoud but the charge was dismissed on the ground that the evidence was as consistent with his innocence as it was with his guilt.
Article 1F(c) required that there be serious reasons for considering that the asylum seeker had been guilty of the acts.
This had an autonomous meaning, and was not the same as the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, or any domestic standard.
Serious reasons was stronger than reasonable grounds, strong or clear and credible evidence had to be present and the considered judgment of the decision maker was required.
The reality was that there were unlikely to be sufficiently serious reasons for considering an applicant to be guilty unless the decision maker could be satisfied that it was more likely than not that he was.
But the task of the decision maker was to apply the words of article 1F(c) in the particular case [75].

uksc-2018-0200,"This appeal concerns the defence of illegality.
The Supreme Court is asked to decide whether the appellant, Ms Henderson, can claim damages for loss she has suffered as a result of her conviction for her mothers manslaughter from the respondent, Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust (Dorset Healthcare).
Ms Henderson suffers from paranoid schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
In August 2010, she was under the care of the Southbourne community mental health team, which was managed and operated by Dorset Healthcare.
On or around 13 August 2010, Ms Hendersons condition began to deteriorate.
On 25 August 2010, she stabbed her mother to death whilst experiencing a serious psychotic episode.
Ms Henderson was convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.
In her criminal trial, the judge said that there was no suggestion that Ms Henderson should be seen as bearing a significant degree of responsibility for what she had done.
The judge sentenced Ms Henderson to a hospital order under section 37 and an unlimited restriction order under section 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983.
She has remained in hospital ever since, and is not expected to be released for some time.
Ms Henderson brought a negligence claim against Dorset Healthcare, seeking damages for personal injury and other loss and damage.
Dorset Healthcare admitted liability for its negligent failure to return Ms Henderson to hospital when her psychiatric condition deteriorated.
It accepted that, if it had done this, the tragic killing of Ms Hendersons mother would not have taken place.
However, it argued that Ms Hendersons claim is barred for illegality, because the damages she claims result from: (i) the sentence imposed on her by the criminal court; and/or (ii) her own criminal act of manslaughter.
Similar claims for damages to those made by Ms Henderson were held to be irrecoverable by the House of Lords in Gray v Thames Trains Ltd [2009] UKHL 33; [2009] AC 1339 (Gray).
The recoverability of the damages claimed was, therefore, ordered to be tried as a preliminary issue.
The High Court judge determined the preliminary issue in favour of Dorset Healthcare, and the Court of Appeal dismissed Ms Hendersons appeal.
Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that the facts of Ms Hendersons claim are materially identical to those in Gray, which was binding upon them.
Ms Henderson appealed to the Supreme Court.
The appeal raises the question of whether Gray can be distinguished and, if not, whether it should be departed from, in particular in the light of the more recent Supreme Court decision concerning illegality in Patel v Mirza [2016] UKSC 42; [2017] AC 467 (Patel).
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Ms Hendersons appeal, and holds that her claim against Dorset Healthcare is barred by the illegality defence.
Lord Hamblen gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.
Ms Hendersons appeal raises three main issues [32].
Issue 1: Can Gray be distinguished? In Gray, the House of Lords held that Mr Grays negligence claim was barred by the defence of illegality because the damages he sought resulted from: (i) the sentence imposed on him by the criminal court; and/or (ii) his own criminal act of manslaughter [36].
The courts below held that the facts of Ms Hendersons and Mr Grays claims are materially identical, so Ms Hendersons claim is barred for illegality for the same reasons as Mr Grays [30 31].
However, Ms Henderson argues that the reasoning in Gray does not apply or can be distinguished, because Gray concerned a claimant with significant personal responsibility for his crime.
In contrast, in Ms Hendersons criminal trial, the judge said that there was no suggestion that Ms Henderson should be seen as bearing a significant degree of responsibility for what she had done [82].
The Court rejects Ms Hendersons argument and finds that Gray cannot be distinguished.
The crucial consideration in Gray was that the claimant had been found to be criminally responsible for his conduct, not the degree of personal responsibility which that reflected [83 86].
Lord Phillips reserved judgment in Gray on whether the illegality defence would apply to a case where the claimant did not bear significant personal responsibility for their crime, but this was not the view of the majority [79 81].
Issue 2: Should the Court depart from Gray? In Patel, the Supreme Court held that the proper approach to the illegality defence at common law was one based on a balancing of public policy considerations rather than a reliance based approach [61].
The majority held the underlying policy question to be whether allowing recovery for something which is illegal would produce inconsistency and disharmony in the law and so cause damage to the integrity of the legal system.
In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, the court should consider a trio of considerations, namely: stage (a) the underlying purpose of the illegality in question, and whether that purpose would be enhanced by denying the claim; stage (b) any other relevant public policy on which denying the claim may have an impact; and stage (c) whether denying the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality [66 68, 113].
With regard to the application of Patel, the Court confirms, first, that it concerned common law illegality rather than statutory illegality [74]; secondly, that although it concerned a claim in unjust enrichment, the Courts decision provides guidance on the proper approach to the common law illegality defence across civil law generally [76]; and thirdly that the principles identified in Patel are derived from the pre existing case law and earlier decisions on the illegality defence remain of precedential value, unless they are incompatible with the Courts reasoning in Patel [77].
Ms Henderson contends that the Court should depart from Gray on three grounds.
The first ground is that the reasoning in Gray is incompatible with the approach to illegality adopted by the Supreme Court in Patel.
The Court finds, however, that the essential reasoning in Gray is consistent with Patel, and so remains good law [89 96].
The second ground is that Gray should not apply where the claimant has no significant personal responsibility for the criminal act and/or there is no penal element in the sentence imposed on them by the criminal court [97 103].
The Court rejects this argument because allowing a claimant to recover damages for loss that results from: (i) the sentence imposed by the criminal court; and/or (ii) an intentional criminal act for which the claimant has been held to be criminally responsible would give rise to inconsistency that is damaging to the integrity of the legal system.
The criminal under the criminal law would become the victim under the civil
law [106].
Requiring the civil court to assess whether or not a civil claimant has a significant degree of personal responsibility for their crime would create a clear risk of inconsistent decisions being reached in the criminal and civil courts [108].
In any case, it is unclear why significant personal responsibility is the appropriate threshold, and how the civil courts should decide whether a claimant meets that threshold [110 111].
There may be some exceptional trivial or strict liability offences which do not engage the illegality defence.
However, the serious criminal offence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility is not one of those exceptions [112].
The third ground is that Ms Hendersons claim would be allowed under the trio of considerations approach in Patel [113 116].
With regard to the trio of considerations, the Court confirms first that they should usually be capable of being addressed as a matter of argument and at a level of generality that does not make evidence necessary [115]; secondly, that they involve a balancing between policy considerations arising under stages (a) and (b) and that stage (c) relates to proportionality and factors specific to the case rather than general policy considerations [116 120]; thirdly, that, where they arise, it is appropriate to give great weight to the policy considerations that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrongdoing and that the law should be coherent [121 122]; fourthly, that where the policy considerations come down firmly against denial of the claim it will not be necessary to consider stage (c) and proportionality [123]; and fifthly, that in relation to proportionality, centrality and the closeness of the causal link between the illegality and the claim will often be factors of particular importance [124].
In relation to stage (a), the policy reasons which support denial of Ms Hendersons claim include the consistency and public confidence principles identified in Gray [119, 125 126].
They also include: (i) the gravity of her criminal offence; (ii) the public interest in the proper allocation of NHS resources; (iii) the very close connection between her claim and her offence; and (iv) the public interest in deterring, protecting the public from and condemning unlawful killing [127 129].
Although a claimant in Ms Hendersons position may not be deterred from unlawful killing by being deprived of a civil right to compensation, there may well be a broader deterrent effect in a clear rule that unlawful killing never pays.
Any such effect is important given the fundamental importance of the right to life.
To have such a rule also supports the public interest in public condemnation and due punishment [130 131].
In relation to stage (b), the policy reasons relied upon for allowing Ms Hendersons negligence claim do not begin to outweigh those which support the denial of the claim.
In particular, as Gray makes clear, the resulting inconsistency in the law is such as to affect the integrity of the legal system and the underlying policy question identified in Patel is accordingly engaged [137].
In relation to stage (c), the four factors relevant to proportionality identified in Patel do not show that denial of the claim would be disproportionate [138 143].
It follows that the trio of considerations approach in Patel does not lead to a different outcome in Ms Hendersons case [144].
Gray should therefore be affirmed as being Patel compliant and should be applied and followed in similar cases [145].
Issue 3: Can Ms Henderson recover damages for any of the heads of loss she has claimed? The Court answers this question no. Ms Henderson cannot claim damages for loss of liberty or for loss of amenity during her detention in hospital because these heads of loss result from the sentence imposed on her by the criminal court.
The other heads of loss cannot be recovered because they result from Ms Hendersons unlawful killing of her mother [148].
It would be inappropriate for the Court to subvert the operation of the Forfeiture Act 1982, which prevents Ms Henderson from recovering her full share of her mothers estate [149].
","Ms Henderson suffers from paranoid schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. On 25 August 2010, she stabbed her mother to death whilst experiencing a serious psychotic episode.

uksc-2017-0103,"Mr Lex Warner chartered a motor vessel operated by Scapa Flow Charters (SFC) for the week of 11 18 August 2012.
On 14 August 2012, when dressed in diving gear while preparing to dive on a wreck northwest of the Cape Wrath, Mr Warner fell onto the deck of the vessel.
He was helped to his feet and went ahead with the dive to a depth of 88 metres.
He got into trouble during the dive and, despite the assistance of other divers who brought him back to the surface of the water and onto the motor vessel, he could not be revived and was pronounced dead.
Mr Warners widow, Debbie Warner, raised an action against SFC in which she alleged that her husbands death was the result of SFCs negligence.
She sought damages both as an individual and as a guardian of their young son, who had been born in November 2011.
SFC lodged a defence that the action was time barred under the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea 1974 (the Athens Convention), which, in the case of a death occurring during carriage, imposes a time bar of two years from the date on which the passenger would have disembarked.
The parties agree that Mr Warner would have disembarked no later than 18 August 2012.
However, the Athens Convention also provides that the law of the court seized of the case in this case, Scots law governs the grounds of suspension and interruption of limitation periods, but in no case can an action be brought after the expiration of a period of three years from the date on which the passenger would have disembarked: article 16(3).
SFC contended that the Scots law of limitation enacted in section 18 of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 (the 1973 Act) does not contain such grounds of suspension and interruption as to extend the limitation period.
It argued that section 18 of the 1973 Act postpones the start of the limitation period instead of interrupting or suspending it as the Athens Convention envisages.
The Lord Ordinary upheld the time bar defence and dismissed the action.
Mrs Warner appealed by reclaiming motion to the Inner House.
The Inner House upheld the Lord Ordinarys opinion in relation to her claim as an individual but reversed his order in relation to her claim on behalf of her son, finding that her claim as guardian of her son was not time barred.
SFC appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Hodge gives the sole judgment with which the other Justices agree.
In interpreting an international convention, national courts must look at the objective meaning of the words used and the purpose of the convention as a whole [14].
Courts in the UK have adopted an approach to interpretation which respects the international character of such a document: the interpretation should not be rigidly controlled by domestic precedents of antecedent date, but rather the language should be construed on broad principles of general acceptation [15].
In carrying out this task, the courts can use as aids to interpretation the travaux prparatoires, the case law of foreign courts on the convention and the writing of jurists, but in respect of the Athens Convention, such aids do not provide assistance [17 18].
Therefore, the Supreme Court relies on the broad, generally accepted principles of interpretation [19].
The Court does not accept that the words suspension and interruption should have a technical meaning derived from certain civil law systems for the following three reasons [20].
Firstly, it is not appropriate to look to the domestic law of certain civil law systems for a technical meaning of the words in an international convention which was designed to operate in many common law systems as well [21].
Secondly, even within civil law systems and mixed legal systems, there was no uniformity in the use of the expression suspension when the Athens Convention was adopted [22].
Thirdly, an interpretation of article 16(3) of the Athens Convention as excluding domestic rules which have the effect of postponing the start of a limitation period would give rise to serious anomalies [28].
The Court therefore holds that the words the grounds of suspension of limitation periods are sufficiently wide to cover domestic rules which postpone the start of a limitation period as well as those which stop the clock after the limitation period has begun [30].
Second, the Court does not accept that the natural meaning of the words grounds of suspension and interruption of limitation periods is limited to grounds which give rise to a break in a period or course of events which is already in train.
For instance, the dictionary definition of suspension referred to by SFC included postponement as one of its meanings, and suspension in the context of prescription or limitation has a broader meaning in several legal systems [32].
The Court also holds that it was unnecessary for the grounds of limitation in a domestic limitation regime to be framed to extend beyond their domestic scope so as to cover limitation periods in conventions such as the Athens Convention [33].
Therefore, the existence of a ground in a domestic limitation statute which suspends the limitation periods set out in that statute is sufficient to bring article 16(3) of the Athens Convention into operation and extend the time bar by one year [33].
The Court then considers whether section 18 of the 1973 Act does in fact extend the time bar in respect of Mrs Warners claim as guardian.
Firstly, the Court observes that the 1973 Act does not postpone the start of the limitation period.
Rather, section 18 of the 1973 Act postpones the expiry date of the limitation period: it instructs a court to disregard the time during which the pursuer of the action is under legal disability [37].
In any event, the Court does not accept that postponement of the start of a limitation period falls outside an international understanding of a suspension of limitation periods [37].
Secondly, the legal disability recognised by section 18 of the 1973 Act has the effect of suspending the running of time on the limitation period under the Athens Convention [38].
Thirdly, that suspension is subject to the long stop of three years, as set out in article 16(3) of the Athens Convention.
The Court therefore concludes that Mrs Warners claim as her sons guardian is not time barred by the Athens Convention [40].
The Court dismisses the appeal [41].

uksc-2016-0003,"The appellants are 14 lead claimants in claims by over 600 Iraqi citizens who claim to have suffered unlawful detention and/or physical maltreatment at the hands of British armed forces in Iraq between 2003 and 2009.
The claims are brought in tort in England against the Ministry of Defence.
The torts are governed by Iraqi law.
The Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 provides that where a claim is brought in England which is governed by a foreign law, the English courts are to apply the foreign law of limitation.
In a substantial number of these cases the action was begun more than three years after the relevant claimant became aware of the injury and the person who caused it, and was therefore time barred under article 232 of the Iraqi Civil Code.
The appellants argued that time had been suspended for limitation purposes under article 435(1) of the Civil Code, which suspends the time limit during any period when there is [an] impediment rendering it impossible for the plaintiff to claim his right.
They said that Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17 (CPA Order 17), which gave coalition forces immunity from Iraqi legal process and jurisdiction and still has force of law in Iraq, was such an impediment.
The first instance judge directed the hearing of a preliminary issue, namely whether the suspensory proviso in article 435(1) applied to the claimants proceedings in England.
He held that the limitation period was suspended under article 435(1).
The Court of Appeal allowed the Ministry of Defences appeal, holding that article 435(1) was not engaged, because the English courts are not bound to apply CPA Order 17, which is a mere procedural bar that is irrelevant to proceedings in England.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal by the Iraqi civilians, and affirms the Court of Appeals conclusion that the limitation period was not suspended under article 435(1) of the Iraqi Civil Code.
Lord Sumption gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.
The Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 requires an English court to apply to English proceedings a foreign law of limitation which will have been designed for proceedings in the foreign country.
This requires a process of transposition.
Facts that the foreign law would have treated as relevant to the foreign proceedings might be irrelevant to the proceedings in England [13].
Where the Iraqi law of limitation depends on some fact about the proceedings, the English court must ask whether that fact is applicable to proceedings brought in England, and not to hypothetical proceedings that might have been brought in Iraq [15].
CPA Order 17 applies only in Iraq.
It is not an
impediment to the only relevant proceedings, which are in England.
It does not therefore suspend the running of the Iraqi law limitation period [16].

uksc-2009-0225,"The Appellant is an Ethiopian national who was the subject of a control order.
This confined him to a flat for 16 hours a day in a Midlands town away from his family in London.
AP came to this country with other members of his family in 1992 at the age of 14.
On 6 October 1999, he, his siblings and their mother were granted indefinite leave to remain.
In May 2005 he travelled to Somalia and then Ethiopia.
On 22 December 2006, upon his detention by the authorities in Ethiopia, the Secretary of State decided to exclude him from the UK.
He was then suspected of involvement in terrorism.
On APs return to the UK on 28 December 2006 he was duly refused leave to enter and, pending removal, detained under immigration powers until July 2007.
He was then released on bail under stringent conditions.
The Secretary of State, however, withdrew her decision to exclude AP from the UK when, on 10 January 2008, she was granted permission to make a control order against him.
The control order subjected AP to a 16 hour curfew and electronic tagging, together with a number of other restrictions on association and communication such as are usually imposed in these cases.
This control order at first required AP to live at an address in North London.
APs family, friends and associates had always lived in the London area.
On 21 April 2008 the Secretary of State modified the terms of the control order, requiring AP to move to an address in a Midlands town some 150 miles away.
It was this modification that led to APs appeal.
On 12 August 2008 the High Court allowed APs appeal against the modification, quashing the obligation to live in the Midlands.
It rejected APs case under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the ground that the interference with his family life was justified and proportionate in the interests of national security but decided that the overall effect of a 16 hour curfew and APs social isolation (particularly through his being separated from his family) constituted an article 5 deprivation of liberty.
When the matter was before the Court of Appeal there was again no dispute about the need for a control order, only about its terms.
The Court of Appeal by a majority reversed the decision of the High Court.
AP appealed.
The outcome of this appeal is no longer currently relevant to AP himself.
APs control order was revoked on 2 July 2009.
The Secretary of State has again decided that AP should be deported on
national security grounds and since 20 July 2009 he has been on bail pending deportation on conditions, including residence in the Midlands, similar to those of the control order save that the curfew period is now 18 hours.
However the points of law raised by APs appeal were said to be of some general importance with regard to control orders.
The three issues the Supreme Court had to reach a decision on in this appeal were as follows: Whether conditions which are proportionate restrictions upon article 8 rights to respect for private and family life can tip the balance in relation to article 5 (which guarantees the right to liberty and security), ie whether they can be taken into account in holding that a control order is a deprivation of liberty when, absent those restrictions, it would not have been held to be such.
Whether the judge can take into account subjective and/or person specific factors, such as the particular difficulties of the subjects family in visiting him in a particular location, when considering whether or not a control order amounts to a deprivation of liberty.
Whether it was permissible for the Court of Appeal to interfere with the first instance judgment on the ground that the judge had relied on findings of fact in respect of article 5 which were inconsistent with his findings of fact in respect of article 8.
The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and restored the High Courts order.
Lord Brown gave the leading judgment.
Lord Rodger and Sir John Dyson SCJ delivered concurring judgments.
By way of introduction, Lord Brown noted that the majority in the House of Lords in Secretary of State for the Home Department v JJ [2008] 1 AC 385 held that deprivation of liberty might take a variety of forms other than classic detention in prison or strict arrest.
The courts task was to consider the concrete situation of the particular individual and, taking account of a whole range of criteria including the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measures in question, to assess their impact on him in the context of the life he might otherwise have been living. (para [1]) In relation to the first issue, Lord Brown considered that the answer was surely an obvious yes.
If an article 8 restriction is a relevant consideration in determining whether a control order breaches article 5, then by definition it is capable of being a decisive factor capable of tipping the balance.
The weight to be given to a relevant consideration is, of course, always a question of fact and entirely a matter for the decision maker subject only to a challenge for irrationality which neither has nor could have been advanced in this case. (para [12]) Lord Brown was of the view that the Secretary of State was wrong to contend that, in assessing the weight to be given to the restrictive effects of a condition such as that imposed on AP here to reside in the Midlands, the judge should ignore everything that depends on the individual circumstances of the family for example, on the facts of this case, that APs mother has never left London alone and that during term time, because of the children, Sunday is the only day the family can travel.
By the same token that it is relevant that, whilst AP must live in the Midlands, his family are in London, so too it is relevant whether their circumstances are such that their distance away so disrupts contact between them as to cause or substantially contribute to APs social isolation.
Plainly the family could not be allowed to thwart what would otherwise be an appropriate residential requirement by unreasonably failing to take opportunities open to them to visit AP and save him from social isolation.
The correct analysis, however, is that in those circumstances it would be the familys unreasonable conduct and not the residence condition which was the operative cause of the APs isolation.
It is not
suggested by the Secretary of State that APs family behaved unreasonably in failing to overcome more effectively the practical difficulties they faced in visiting AP on a more regular basis, only that their particular difficulties should have been ignored.
That submission cannot be accepted. (para [15]) In relation to the third issue, having considered the relevant parts of the High Courts judgment, Lord Brown held that there was no contradiction between them. (paras [1618])
","The Appellant is an Ethiopian national who was the subject of a control order. This confined him to a flat for 16 hours a day in a Midlands town away from his family in London.

uksc-2010-0145,"By October 2003 pressure groups had complained that coverage by the British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] of the Israeli Palestinian conflict was not impartial [6].
In November 2003 Mr Malcolm Balen was appointed by the BBC to produce a report on the quality and impartiality of its coverage of Middle Eastern affairs [the Balen Report], which was intended to be an internal briefing document [6 7].
In November 2004 the Balen Report was considered by the BBCs Journalism Board, which consequently commissioned a paper called Taking Forward BBC Coverage of the Middle East [9].
A number of internal changes resulted, including development of training, auditing of on air use of experts and the creation of a post of Middle East Editor [10].
On 8 January 2005, the Appellant, Mr Steven Sugar, made a request pursuant to s.1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 [FOIA] for disclosure of the Balen Report [12].
The BBC is designated as a public authority in FOIA only to a limited extent, namely in respect of information held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature [1].
The BBC refused the request on the basis that it held the Balen Report for purposes of journalism and thus it lay beyond the scope of FOIA [12].
In March 2005 Mr Sugar applied to the Information Commissioner pursuant to s.50(1) of FOIA for a decision whether the BBC had determined his request within the terms of FOIA.
The Commissioner concluded that the BBC had lawfully rejected his request as, even if the Balen Report had also been held for non journalistic purposes, it continued to lie beyond the scope of FOIA because the journalistic purpose was manifestly dominant [13].
The Commissioner also observed that BBC was not a public authority for the purposes of FOIA and thus Mr Sugar had no right of appeal under s.57 of FOIA to the Information Tribunal [15].
On 30 December 2005 Mr Sugar nevertheless appealed to the Tribunal, which determined it had jurisdiction.
The House of Lords upheld its jurisdiction decision (in Sugar v BBC [2009] UKHL 9) since, even in relation to a request for information which was held to lie outside the designation, the BBC remained a public authority for the purposes of FOIA [20].
Before the Tribunal, Mr Sugar contended that even if the information is held only partly for purposes other than those of journalism, the information is within the scope of FOIA [4].
The BBCs primary contention was that where information is held for the purposes of journalism, that information is beyond the scope of FOIA even if it is also held even predominantly held for purposes other than journalism [3].
The BBCs secondary contention was that the information is within the scope of FOIA only if the purposes other than journalism are the dominant purpose for which it is held [5].
On 29 August 2006 the Tribunal accepted the BBCs secondary contention but held that the Balen Report was within the scope of FOIA as, once the report had been placed before the Journalism Board, it was held predominantly for purposes other than journalism [21].
On 2 October 2009 Mr Justice Irwin allowed the BBCs appeal on the basis that the BBC had no obligation to disclose information that the BBC held to any significant extent for the purposes of journalism and further that, even if the test was one of dominant purpose, the Tribunal had erred in finding that the Balen Report had been held predominantly for purposes other than those of journalism [22].
The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Sugars appeal, rejecting the dominant purpose construction and approving the BBCs primary construction of the designation [23].
Sadly Mr Sugar died in January 2011.
The court appointed his widow, Ms Fiona Paveley, to represent his estate in this appeal [4].
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Phillips, Lord Walker, Lord Brown and Lord Mance dismiss the appeal on the basis that, even if information is held only partly for the purposes of journalism, art or literature, it is outside the scope of FOIA.
Lord Wilson would have dismissed it on the basis that, if
information is held predominantly for the purposes of journalism, art or literature, it is outside the scope of FOIA and that the Balen Report was held predominantly for those purposes [57].
Section 7(1) of FOIA provides that, where a public authority is listed in Schedule 1 of FOIA only in relation to information of a specified description, nothing in Parts I to V of FOIA is to apply to any other information held by the authority [31; 69].
Under Part VI of Schedule I to FOIA the BBC is designated as a public authority only in respect of information held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature [1].
At the material time BBC held the Balen Report for the purposes of journalism.
The issue is therefore how the phrase purposes other than those of journalism should be construed [2].
Four possible categories of information held by the BBC exist: (1) information held exclusively for purposes other than those of journalism [or art or literature]; (2) information held predominantly, but not exclusively, for non journalistic purposes; (3) information held predominantly, but not exclusively, for journalistic purposes and (4) information held exclusively for journalistic purposes [73].
The Appellant argued that the BBCs immunity under Part VI of Schedule I to FOIA was limited to information in category (4).
The BBCs primary contention, upheld by Irwin J and the Court of Appeal, was that the BBC had to disclose information only in category (1) subject to particular exemptions under other provisions of FOIA [73].
The BBCs secondary contention, adopting a dominant purpose construction, was that only information in categories (1) and (2) had to be disclosed, subject to the exemptions.
The court holds that the Court of Appeal was correct in deciding that once it is established that the information sought is held by the BBC to any significant degree for the purposes of journalism, it is exempt from production under FOIA, even if the information is also held for other purposes [67; 75; 104; 111].
The legislative purpose of FOIA is to promote an important public interest in access to information about public bodies [76]; but in this case there is a powerful public interest that the public service broadcasters, no less than the commercial media, should be free to gather, edit and publish news and comment on current affairs without the inhibition of an obligation to make public disclosure of or about their work [78].
The purpose of the designation would have failed if the coexistence of other non journalistic purposes resulted in the loss of immunity [78].
The real emphasis of the words is on what is not disclosable, namely material held for the purposes of the BBCs broadcasting output [79].
The Tribunal should have some regard to the directness of purpose, considering the proximity between the subject matter of the request and the BBCs journalistic activities and output [83].
The purpose of the designation is to protect the BBC from interference with its functions in broadcasting journalism, art and literature [64] and consequently a purposive construction of it would prevent disclosure that would risk such interference [65].
Information should be found to be held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature only if an immediate object of holding the information is to use it for one of those purposes [67].
As to the contention on behalf of the Appellant that this approach would violate Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights [ECHR], the Court noted the well established body of jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that defines the nature of the right under Article 10(1) as prohibiting a government from restricting a person from receiving information that others are willing to impart to him but does not construe the article as imposing positive obligations on a State to disseminate information of its own motion [89].
The jurisprudence relied upon by the Appellant falls far short of establishing that an individuals freedom to receive information is interfered with whenever a public authority acting consistently with domestic legislation refuses access to documents [94].
Article 10 creates no general right to freedom of information [94] and consequently no interference with Mr Sugars ECHR rights [97].
Even if there had been such a right, it would be open to the State to legislate a blanket exclusion of any requirement to disclose information held for the purposes of journalism [98].

uksc-2014-0067,"Section 188(1) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (the 1992 Act) requires that employers which propose to dismiss as redundant twenty or more employees at one establishment within a period of 90 days or less have an obligation to consult with the representatives of any employees who may be affected.
In order to deal with a budget deficit in the year 2009 2010 the University of Stirling proposed to make up to 140 of its permanent staff redundant.
In accordance with section 188(1) of the 1992 Act, it undertook collective consultation with the relevant trade unions, including the University and College Union (the Union).
However, it did not consider that it needed to include in the collective consultation process employees who were employed under limited term contracts (LTCs) which came to an end during the consultation period.
The Union considered that employees on LTCs should have been included on the grounds that they had been dismissed as redundant and brought four test cases in the Employment Tribunal on this basis.
The Employment Tribunal held that the employees in three of the four test cases had been dismissed as redundant for the purpose of the consultation requirement and that the fourth employee had not been dismissed at all.
The Employment Appeal Tribunal held that all four of the test case employees had been dismissed, but that none of them had been dismissed as redundant.
The Inner House agreed with the Employment Appeal Tribunal.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Unions appeal and remits the case to the Employment Tribunal for consideration of the remaining issues.
The Court considered that the issue of whether employees on LTCs, whose contracts come to an end within the relevant period have been dismissed as redundant depends upon two questions.
The first question was whether the expiry and non renewal of an LTC amounts to a dismissal for this purpose.
It was common ground between the parties that it did [15].
The second question was whether such a dismissal is for a reason not related to the individual concerned, which is the statutory definition of dismissal as redundant pursuant to section 195(1) of the 1992 Act.
The Court held that it was.
The fact that the employee had entered into an LTC could not mean that the dismissal was a reason related to the individual.
In passing the 1992 Act, Parliament did not intend to narrow the scope of the consultation duty from situations where business ceased or was reduced.
Further, Parliament had specifically legislated in order to encompass situations where employees are dismissed and offered new contracts on different terms.
If the terms and conditions of
employees employment contracts were reasons related to the individual concerned then such business rearrangements would not be covered [20].
The context and content of the duty to consult suggest that it is concerned with the needs of the business as a whole.
While being on an LTC might be a criterion for selecting employees for dismissal, it is a collective description rather than a reason relating to the individual concerned [21].
Where an LTC comes to an end, the dismissal is the failure to offer the employee a new contract.
The fact that it was an LTC, or even that the employee agreed to it, cannot by itself be a reason for the non renewal.
The question is whether the reasons for the failure to offer a new contract relate to the individual or to the needs of the business [22].
A reason relates to the individual if it is something to do with him or something he has done.
It is to be distinguished from a reason relating to the employer, such as the need to effect change in the business.
The coming to an end of an LTC was a reason related to the employers business, not to the individual concerned [23].

uksc-2014-0210,"The issues in the appeal were (1) whether there should be a presumption of anonymity in civil proceedings in the High Court relating to a patient detained in a psychiatric hospital or otherwise subject to compulsory powers under the Mental Health Act 1983 (the MHA 1983) and (2) whether there should be an anonymity order on the facts of this particular case.
The appellant, C, who had a history of severe mental health problems, was convicted of murdering his former girlfriend and her partner in 1997.
He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff subsequently set at 11 years.
During his imprisonment he was transferred to a high security psychiatric hospital on the direction of the Secretary of State for Justice under the MHA 1983 for psychiatric treatment, with a restriction order which meant that the appellant could not be granted leave of absence, transferred to another hospital, or discharged without the consent of the Secretary of State.
In July 2012 the appellants responsible clinician applied unsuccessfully for consent for the appellant to have unescorted leave in the community to assess his suitability for discharge.
The appellant applied for discharge to the Firsttier tribunal.
On 25 April 2013 the tribunal notified the Secretary of State that conditional discharge (subject to supervision, supported accommodation and further treatment) would be suitable for the appellant, but that if he was not conditionally discharged he should remain in hospital.
The Secretary of State referred the case to the Parole Board.
The appellants responsible clinician then made a further application for consent for the appellant to have unescorted community leave, which the Secretary of State refused on 18 October 2013.
The appellant applied for judicial review of that decision.
In December 2013 the High Court ordered that the appellant be anonymised in the proceedings and granted permission to bring the claim.
The claim was rejected by Cranston J, who also refused an application for the anonymity order to remain in force.
The appellant appealed in relation to the refusal of anonymity, but the Court of Appeal upheld the judges order.
The appellant brought a further appeal on the anonymity issue to the Supreme Court.
In the meantime the Parole Board approved the appellants conditional release on life licence and he was released from hospital in October 2015.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal against the refusal to maintain the anonymity order protecting the appellant.
It finds that there is no presumption of anonymity and the question in High Court proceedings relating to the compulsory powers under the MHA 1983 is whether an order for
anonymity is necessary in the interests of the patient.
Such an order was necessary in the appellants interests in this case.
Lady Hale gives the only substantive judgment.
The rules governing privacy and anonymity in all civil proceedings in the High Court are found in rule 39.2 of the Civil Procedure Rules [15].
The general rule that hearings should be held in public is subject to established exceptions in relation to whole classes of hearings such as those relating to children, which should normally be heard in private [17].
Most of the important safeguards secured by a public hearing can be achieved without the press publishing or the public knowing the identities of the people involved, but it is for the court and not the parties to balance the interests at stake [18].
It is necessary to distinguish between ordinary civil proceedings in which a mental patient may be involved, and proceedings concerning the compulsory powers under the MHA 1983 [21].
For the latter there is a presumption of privacy and anonymity in the rules governing applications to the First tier and Upper tribunals [24].
Similar rules providing for anonymity are in place for the Court of Protection, the other specialist jurisdiction dealing with people with mental disorders or disabilities [25].
As regards the High Court, it was recognised by the House of Lords in the leading case of Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 that the principle of open justice did not extend to proceedings relating to wards of court and to lunatics.
The Court of Appeal in the present case wrongly treated this exception as limited to private law litigation concerned with the protection and administration of property, when in fact there were already statutory powers similar to the compulsory powers under the MHA 1983 at the time of the decision of the House of Lords, and the judicial safeguards for patients under those statutes were also conducted in private [29].
The closest analogy with the present case was with proceedings in the tribunals, which were concerned with risk as well as diagnosis when considering applications in respect of transferred prisoners and restricted patients [31].
The privacy rules in the tribunals were a proper and proportionate departure from the principle of open justice [32], as the hearings inevitably involved examination of confidential medical examination about the patient.
Judicial review of the Secretary of States decisions as to discharge of such patients was no different [33].
Fear of disclosure of confidential information might inhibit a patient from frank dealings with his medical team and from bringing proceedings to challenge his detention or treatment [34].
The question in all these cases was that set out in CPR 31.2(4), namely whether anonymity was necessary in the interests of the patient.
There should not be a presumption in favour of anonymity in every case but a balance should be struck between the public right to information about decisions in respect of notorious criminals and the potential harm to the patient and all others whose treatment could be affected by the risk of exposure [36].
The present case concerned a horrendous crime which caused incalculable distress to the families of the victims, who have statutory rights to be informed about the arrangements made for the discharge of the appellant should they so wish [37].
The public interest in knowing how difficult and sensitive cases of this sort were decided was protected by holding a public hearing, even if the identity of the patient concerned was not disclosed [38].
In this case there was a risk to the appellant from members of the public.
He was much more likely to lead a successful life in the community if his identity was not generally known [39].
Putting all these factors into the balance an anonymity order was necessary in the interests of the appellant, without which there was a real risk that his long years of treatment and reintegration into the community would not succeed [40].

uksc-2014-0092,"This appeal concerns PH, a young man with physical and learning disabilities, who was born in Wiltshire in 1986.
He lacks capacity to decide for himself where he lives.
Since 1991, PH has been living with foster parents in South Gloucestershire.
In 1991 PHs parents moved away from Wiltshire to Cornwall.
PH occasionally visited them there, including at the end of 2004 just before his eighteenth birthday.
Since he turned eighteen, PH has lived in two care homes in Somerset.
The cost of PHs care is currently estimated to be 80,000 per year for the rest of his life.
There is no dispute that he is entitled to support.
The issue is which local authority is responsible for providing PHs support South Gloucestershire, Cornwall, or Wiltshire? This depends, under sections 24(1) and 24(5) of the National Assistance Act 1948, on where PH was ordinarily resident immediately before he attained majority.
Wiltshire Council arranged PHs foster placement under the Children Act 1989.
Section 105(6)(c) provides that, in determining a childs ordinary residence for the purposes of the 1989 Act, there shall be disregarded any period in which the child lives in any place while he is being provided with accommodation by or on behalf of the local authority.
At the time PH turned 18, the National Assistance Act 1948 section 21 obliged local authorities to arrange accommodation for people over eighteen with disabilities who need care and attention not otherwise available to them (the application of the 1948 Act has since been restricted to Wales).
By section 24(5), a person provided with accommodation under the 1948 Act is deemed to continue to be ordinarily resident in the area in which he was ordinarily resident immediately before that accommodation was provided for him.
Section 105(6)(c) and section 24(5) have been referred to as deeming or disregard provisions.
In August 2011, the three local authorities jointly referred the question of PHs ordinary residence to the appellant Secretary of State for determination, under section 32(3) of the 1948 Act.
The Secretary of State decided that Cornwall Council was responsible.
He followed his own guidance on determining ordinary residence, which draw on two principal authorities: R v Barnet LBC, ex p Shah [1983] AC 309, and R v Waltham Forest, Ex p Vale (unreported, 11 February 1985).
In Shah, the House of Lords held that ordinary residence connotes an abode voluntarily adopted for settled purposes.
In Vale the High Court held that an adult woman whose disabilities meant she was incapable of choosing where to live had her ordinary residence with her parents, because that was her base.
The Secretary of State applied this approach, which was challenged in this appeal.
Cornwall Council judicially reviewed the Secretary of States decision.
The High Court dismissed its challenge.
The Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that PHs place of ordinary residence as at his eighteenth birthday was South Gloucestershire, and further that the deeming provisions did not apply to PH since each applied only for the purposes of their own Act.
The Supreme Court allows the appeals by a majority of 4 1, and determines PHs ordinary residence at the relevant time to be Wiltshire.
Lord Carnwath gives a judgment with which Lady Hale, Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson agree.
Lord Wilson gives a dissenting judgment.
Lord Carnwath considers that the Secretary of States reasons for selecting Cornwall, which started not from assessment of the duration and quality of PHs actual residence but from an attempt to ascertain his base by reference to his family relationships, cannot be supported.
There is no suggestion that PHs brief periods of staying with his parents at holiday times could amount to ordinary residence. [49] Lord Carnwath further reasons that though attribution of responsibility to South Gloucestershire may fit the language of the statute, it runs directly counter to the statutes policy.
The only connection with that county was PHs historic placement under a statute, the 1989 Act, which specifically excluded the placement from consideration as ordinary residence for the purposes of the 1989 Act.
The policy in both the 1989 and 1948 Acts is that ordinary residence of a person provided with accommodation should not be affected, for the purposes of an authoritys responsibilities, by the location of that persons placement.
The purpose of the deeming provisions in both Acts is that an authority should not be able to export its responsibility for providing accommodation by exporting the person who is in need of it.
It would be undesirable if, despite the similarity and purpose of these provisions, there is a hiatus in the legislation.
It could also have adverse consequences on local authorities willingness to receive children who need specialist care from another local authority. [52 55] Lord Carnwath notes that in construing section 24 of the 1948 Act, the statutory context is critical.
The relevant provisions in each Act have the same function, namely allocating fiscal and administrative responsibility between local authorities. [57] PH was at the relevant time living somewhere he had been placed by a local authority under the 1989 Act.
It would be wrong to interpret section 24 of the 1948 Act so as to regard PH as having been ordinarily resident in South Gloucestershire by reason of a form of residence whose legal characteristics are found in the 1989 Act.
One of those characteristics is that the foster placement did not affect his ordinary residence under the 1989 Acts statutory scheme. [58 59] It follows that PHs placement in South Gloucestershire by Wiltshire is not to be regarded as changing his ordinary residence.
Until he turned eighteen, for fiscal and administrative purposes his ordinary residence continued to be in Wiltshire, regardless of where they determined that he should live. [60] Therefore the appeal is allowed and in the declaration of the Court of Appeal references to South Gloucestershire are substituted for references to Wiltshire. [61] Lord Wilson, dissenting, reasons that at the relevant date PH and his family had all moved away from Wiltshire. [62] South Gloucestershire is the result that the law clearly compels on the established meaning of ordinary residence, though public policy militates against it. [65 66, 68] Though he did not adopt it voluntarily, PH was happy and settled there. [74] Parliament has not chosen to widen the provisions in the 1948 Act so as to disregard an adults previous placement as a minor under the 1989 Act.
The majoritys analysis that the legal characteristics of a minors residence under the 1989 Act make it irrelevant to determining ordinary residence under section 24 of the 1948 Act makes the statutory disregards in section 105(6) of the 1989 Act and section 24(5) of the 1948 Act redundant. [70 71]

uksc-2010-0022,"The question in this appeal is whether a person who has been detained by the police in Scotland on suspicion of having committed an offence has the right of access to a lawyer prior to being interviewed.
Sections 14 and 15 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 allow a police constable to detain a person whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting has committed or is committing an offence punishable by imprisonment.
Detention may last for up to six hours.
During detention, the police may put questions to the detainee, although the detainee is under no obligation to answer them and is to be informed at the outset of the detention that he is under no such obligation.
The detainee is entitled to have a solicitor informed of his detention.
However, in terms of the statute, the detainee has no right of access to a solicitor.
The question is whether that is a breach of the right to a fair trial, recognised in Article 6(1) and 6(3)(c) of the European Convention of Human Rights (the ECHR).
The Appellant was detained by the police on suspicion of serious assault and cautioned, in line with the statute, that he did not have to answer any question, beyond giving his name, address, date and place of birth and nationality.
He was told that he was entitled to have a solicitor informed of his detention but he did not exercise that right.
He was interviewed without a lawyer being present.
During interview, the Appellant made a number of admissions.
At trial the Crown led evidence of the police interview with the Appellant and relied on the admissions.
The Appellant was convicted.
In Salduz v Turkey (2008) 49 EHRR 421 the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights unanimously held that there had been a violation of Articles 6(1) and 6(3)(c) ECHR because Salduz had not had the benefit of legal advice when he was in police custody.
In Her Majestys Advocate v McLean [2009] HCJAC 97, the High Court of Justiciary (sitting with seven judges) held that, notwithstanding the decision in Salduz, it was not a violation of Articles 6(1) & 6(3)(c) ECHR for the Crown to rely at trial on admissions made by a detainee while being interviewed without having had access to a solicitor.
This was because the guarantees otherwise available in the Scottish legal system (and, in particular, the requirement that there be corroborated evidence in order to convict) were sufficient to provide for a fair trial.
In the present case, relying on the decision in McLean, the appeal court refused the Appellant leave to appeal against his conviction.
In effect, therefore, the present case is an appeal against the decision in McLean.
The Supreme Court unanimously grants leave to appeal and then goes on to allow the appeal.
The ECHR requires that a person who has been detained by the police has the right to have access to a lawyer prior to being interviewed, unless in the particular circumstances of the case there are
compelling reasons to restrict that right.
The Supreme Court remits the case to the High Court of Justiciary for further procedure.
Lord Hope (Deputy President) delivers the leading judgment, with which Lord Mance agrees.
Lord Rodger delivers a separate judgment, agreeing with Lord Hope but adding observations of his own.
Lord Walker, Lord Brown, Lord Kerr and Sir John Dyson SCJ agree with the reasons given by both Lord Hope and Lord Rodger.
The High Court of Justiciarys decision in McLean was entirely in line with previous domestic authority: [29] That authority cannot, however, survive in light of the European Court of Human Rights decision in Salduz and in subsequent cases.
Properly interpreted, Salduz requires a detainee to have had access to a lawyer from the time of the first interview unless there are compelling reasons, in light of the particular circumstances of the case, to restrict that right: [35], [36], [38] & [70].
The exception applies only if there are particular circumstances in the individual case and does not allow a systematic departure from the rule such as that set up by the 1995 Act: [41].
The rule in Salduz is based on the right not to incriminate oneself: [33] & [67].
This court should follow Salduz.
Indeed, it has no real option but to do so: [93].
Previous cases have established that the court should follow any clear and consistent jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court: [45].
Salduz is a decision of the Grand Chamber, now firmly established in the European Court of Human Rights case law: [48].
The majority of those member states which prior to Salduz did not afford a right to legal representation at interview (Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Ireland) are reforming their laws to bring them into line with the Conventions requirements: [49].
The guarantees otherwise offered by the Scottish legal system (in particular corroboration) are commendable but are beside the point.
They do not address the European Courts concern, which is with self incrimination: [50], [66] & [92].
The system of detention under section 14 and 15 of the 1995 Act was expressly designed to deny an individual, reasonably suspected of committing a crime, a right to obtain legal advice when questioned in the hope that, without legal advice, the individual would be more likely to incriminate himself during questioning: [91].
That view of where the balance is to be struck between the public interest and the rights of the accused is irreconcilable with Convention rights: [51].
There is not the remotest chance that the European Court would hold that, because of the other protections that Scots law provides for accused persons, the Scottish system could omit the safeguard of allowing legal advice prior to interview: [93].
The Lord Advocate could not rely upon section 57(3) of the Scotland Act 1998 to prevent her act of leading the evidence of the interview from being unlawful.
Section 57(3) would apply where, because of another provision of legislation, the Lord Advocate could not have acted any differently or where she acted to give effect to another provision which could not be read in a way which complies with Convention rights.
Neither applied here because of the drafting of section 14(7) of the 1995 Act: [54] & [55].
This decision does not permit closed cases to be re opened.
Although a judicial decision has retrospective effect, it does not affect cases which have been finally determined (namely, where an accused was convicted and did not appeal within the relevant time limits, or did appeal and the appeal has been finally disposed of).
The decision will, however, affect cases which have not yet gone to trial, where the trial is still in progress or where an appeal has been brought in time and is not yet concluded.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, if it is asked to do so, will have to determine whether it is in the public interest for cases which have already been finally determined to be referred to the High Court, which will in turn have to decide how to deal with such cases, if a reference is made: [60] [62]; [99] [103].
","Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 allows a police constable to detain a person whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting has committed or is committing an offence punishable by imprisonment. Police may put questions to the detainee, although the detainee is under no obligation to answer them. The detainee is entitled to have a solicitor informed of his detention. The question is whether that is a breach of the right to a fair trial.",0.1157154026583268,0.11119812059514486,0.1157154026583268,0.1157154026583268,2.2342375584662755e-07
uksc-2017-0135,"This matter centres around a married man and woman who, until 2015, had been living together in Australia with their two children.
By the end of 2014 the marriage was in difficulties.
The mother, who holds British citizenship, wanted to make a trip to England with the children before returning to work from maternity leave.
The father agreed to an eight week stay.
The mother and the children came to England on 4 May 2015 where they have since remained.
Discussions between the mother and father resulted in the father agreeing to an extension of the eight week visit up to a year.
Based on the extension, the mother gave notice to her employer and looked for work in England.
In September 2015, the mother enrolled the older child at a local pre school.
Without telling the father, on 2 November 2015, she applied for British citizenship for both children who had entered England on six month visitor visas.
Her solicitors wrote a letter to the immigration authorities on her behalf indicating that she and the children could not return to Australia for fear of domestic abuse.
In continuing correspondence, the father pressed the mother on the childrens expected date of return.
The mother indicated that she did not know what her plans were but made clear that she would not be returning in May 2016.
In June 2016, she expressed her intention to remain in the UK.
The father made an application in the High Court under the Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the Abduction Convention).
The issue of when the mother had decided not to return to Australia was in contention.
The mothers own case was that by April 2016 she had felt she and the children would not be returning.
The arguments before the Court meant that, on any view, there was a decision not to return to Australia before the expiry of the agreed year.
The judge held that the children were habitually resident in England and Wales by the end of June 2016 so that mandatory summary return was unavailable under the Abduction Convention.
But he accepted mothers evidence that she did not have the intention, in November 2015, or before April 2016, not to return to Australia.
The mother now appeals against the Court of Appeals decision.
The issues in the appeal are: (1) what is the effect on an application under the Abduction Convention if a child has become habitually resident in the destination state before the act relied on as a wrongful removal or retention occurs; and (2) if a child has been removed from their home state by agreement with the left behind parent for a limited period can there be a wrongful retention before the agreed period of absence expires (so called repudiatory retention)? The father cross appeals on the issue of habitual residence.
The Supreme Court allows the appeal and dismisses the cross appeal.
Lord Hughes gives the lead judgment with whom Lady Hale and Lord Carnwath agree.
Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson each give judgments concurring on the two points of principle but dissenting on the outcome of this case on its facts.
Issue 1 When considering the general scheme of the Abduction Convention, the construction that summary return is available if, by the time of the act relied on as a wrongful removal or retention, a child is habitually resident in the state where the application for return is made is unpersuasive.
That construction is inconsistent with the operation of the Abduction Convention since 1980 and its treatment by subsequent international legal instruments. [19] The Abduction Convention is designed to provide a summary remedy which negates the pre emptive force of wrongful removal or retention and to defeat forum shopping. [21] The point of the scheme adopted by the Abduction Convention was to leave the merits to be decided by the courts of the place of the childs habitual residence.
If the forum state is the habitual residence of the child, there can be no place for a summary return to somewhere else, without a merits based decision.
This understanding of the scheme of the Abduction Convention is reflected in the provisions of both the Revised Brussels II Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention on Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. [23] The Abduction Convention cannot be invoked if by the time of the alleged wrongful act, whether by removal or retention, the child is habitually resident in the state where the request for return is lodged.
In such a case, that state has primary jurisdiction to decide on the merits, based on the childs habitual residence, and there is no room for a mandatory summary decision. [34] Issue 2 Repudiatory retention has been recognised in some jurisdictions, but no generally accepted international practice or authority exists on the point. [39] The desirability of inducing a prompt change of mind in the retaining parent is an argument for recognising a repudiatory retention when and if it occurs.
The 12 month time limit for seeking mandatory summary return runs from the point a repudiatory retention occurs and that period may pass before an applicant is aware of the repudiatory retention.
However, it is not a limitation period but a provision in the childs interest to limit mandatory summary return.
Once elapsed it renders a summary return discretionary.
The concern that repudiatory retention would make Abduction Convention applications longer and more complicated is a point well made.
However, Family Division judges are used to managing applications actively and controlling any tendency to spill outside the relevant issues.
Further, if repudiatory retention requires an overt act or statement, this lessens the danger of speculative applications. [46 48] Repudiatory retention is possible in law.
The objections to it are insubstantial, whereas the arguments in favour are convincing and conform to the scheme of the Abduction Convention.
It would be unwise to attempt an exhaustive definition of proof or evidence.
An objectively identifiable act of repudiation is required, but it need not be communicated to the left behind parent nor does an exact date need to be identifiable. [50 51] On the present facts there could not have been a wrongful retention in April 2016 as the mothers internal thinking could not by itself amount to such.
If she had such an intention in November 2015, the application to the immigration authorities could have amounted to a repudiatory retention.
But it was open to the judge to believe the mothers evidence that she did not possess this intention in November. [55] There is no basis in law for criticising the judges decision as to habitual residence. [57] Lord Kerr dissents on the outcome of this case on its facts.
He expresses misgivings about repudiatory retention requiring an overt act by the travelling parent. [63] The judges finding that wrongful retention did not arise in this case could not be reconciled with his statement that the mother had concluded by April 2016 that she and the children should remain in England. [68] Moreover, the judges conclusion that the mother had not formed any intention to retain the children in England in November 2015 is insupportable as he failed to address the question of what bearing the letter of November 2015 had on her intention. [72] Lord Wilson also dissents on the outcome of this case on its facts.
The solicitors letter to the immigration authorities in November 2015 represented a major obstacle to any finding that the mother had not by then intended to keep the children in the UK indefinitely.
The judges finding as to the mothers intention in November 2015 was flawed and the Court of Appeal were correct to order a fresh inquiry into her intention. [91 92]

uksc-2013-0146,"In order to trade, sex shops in Westminster need a licence from Westminster City Council (Westminster) under schedule 3 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, paragraph 19 of which provides that an applicant for the grant, renewal or transfer of a licenceshall pay a reasonable fee determined by the appropriate authority [1].
European Union law has placed limits upon the licence fees which can be charged.
Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC, given domestic effect by regulation 18(4) of the Provision of Services Regulation 2009 SI No 2999, provides that the authorisation procedures and formalities for applicants shall not be dissuasiveand any charges which the applicants may incur from their application shall be reasonable and proportionate to the cost of the authorisation procedures in question and shall not exceed the cost of the procedures.
Mr Hemming runs sex shops in the Westminster area under the name Simply Pleasure Ltd. Westminster has over past years required applicants for sex shop licences to pay with their applications a substantial sum (29,435 in 2011/12), broken down into a smaller amount (2,667 in 2011/12) relating to the processing of the application and a larger amount (26,435 in 2011/12) relating to the cost of administering and enforcing the licensing regime as a whole.
The larger amount was refundable whenever an application failed [2].
Mr Hemming claims that this system was illegitimate under domestic and EU law.
His primary case has been that there is no basis for requiring successful or unsuccessful applicants to meet the costs of administering and enforcing the regime.
But he has also developed a secondary case, that there was no basis for requiring such costs to be paid with the applications, even on a refundable basis.
The courts below agreed with Mr Hemmings primary case, holding that such costs had to be funded by an authority such as Westminster out of its general rates or other funds [4].
Westminster appeals to the Supreme Court, submitting that: (1) Under domestic law, paragraph 19 is wide enough to cover the fees it charged. (2) Under EU law, article 13(2) and regulation 18(4) are concerned only with charges made in respect of authorisation procedures and their cost.
The refundable amounts are not a cost of the application but a cost of the application succeeding. (3) Alternatively, if that is wrong, then the authorisation procedures and formalities to which article 13(2) refers can be interpreted widely enough to include all aspects of the licensing scheme, including the costs of enforcing the scheme against unlicensed operators, so that the
total sum required to be paid with applications can be regarded as a cost of such procedures and formalities.
The Supreme Court, Lord Mance giving its unanimous judgment, allows the appeal in part but, on the critical question of whether it was lawful to require payment of the larger refundable amounts with the applications, makes a reference to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
The Court concludes that: (1) Paragraph 19 of schedule 3 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 enables a licencing authority to impose on an applicant a fee for the grant or renewal of a licence which covers the running and enforcement costs of the licensing scheme, to be payable either (a) at the time when the licence is granting; or (b) on a refundable basis, at the time when the application is lodged [7]. (2) Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC deals only with authorisation procedures and fees relating to applications for permission to access or exercise a service activity, such as operating a sex shop.
It does not prevent the imposition on those who receive licences of proportionate charges to fund the cost of administering and enforcing the licensing regime [15] [17]. (3) As to the legitimacy of Westminsters system, it is helpful to distinguish between two types of scheme.
Under Type A, applications for licences are made on terms that the applicant must, upon their application being granted, pay a fee to cover the cost of administering and enforcing the licensing regime.
Under Type B, which represents the scheme actually adopted by Westminster, applications for licences are made on terms that the applicant must, at the time of making the application, pay a fee, refundable in the event that the application fails, to cover the cost of administering and enforcing the licensing regime [18]. (4) Type A schemes are permissible under regulation 18(4) of the Provision of Services Regulation 2009 SI No 2999 and article 13(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC, because they permit a licensing authority to charge a successful applicant with a proportionate part of the cost of administering and enforcing the licensing regime as a whole [19]. (5) Whether article 13(2) also permits Type B schemes is more problematic, because payment is required to be made by every applicant, albeit on a potentially refundable basis, at the time when the application is made.
There was no evidence that a Type B scheme could or would have a potentially dissuasive effect upon applicants but it remains unclear whether it involves in law a charge incurred from the application, contrary to article 13(2) [20] [24]. (6) A reference to the Court of Justice is therefore required on whether and when a Type B scheme is consistent with article 13(2).
The parties are invited to make proposals on the wording of the question to be referred [25].

uksc-2011-0247,"On 9 September 1988, the Appellant (SerVaas) entered into an agreement with the Iraqi Ministry of Industry for the supply of equipment, machinery and related services required for the commissioning of a state owned copper and brass processing factory in Iraq.
On 2 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and on 4 August 1990, the assets of Rafidain Bank (Rafidain) in the UK were frozen in accordance with a United Nations sanctions regime.
On 13 August 1990 SerVaas terminated the agreement and subsequently commenced proceedings in the Paris Commercial Court against the Ministry to recover money due under the agreement.
It gave judgment in favour of SerVaas for US$14,152,800 (the Judgment).
The Judgment was recognised in the Netherlands and SerVaas recovered US$966,515 by partial enforcement there against Iraqs assets.
In July 2002, SerVaas received US$6,736,285 from the UN Claims Commission by way of compensation for losses caused by Iraq as a result of the invasion of Kuwait.
In May 2003, the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq fell.
On 22 May 2003 the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1483 establishing the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI).
On 21 November 2004, Iraq made a debt cancellation agreement with government creditors comprising the Paris Club.
In December 2004, Iraq began a process of debt restructuring with its commercial creditors and the creditors of other specified Iraqi entities, including Rafidain under the auspices of the Iraq Debt Reconciliation Office (the IDRO Scheme).
Rafidain, in the meantime, had had a winding up petition presented in respect of it by the Bank of England, in relation to which Provisional Liquidators had been appointed in respect of its UK assets, but which petition had been adjourned generally.
On 26 July 2005, Iraq announced an offer to repurchase claims for the commercial creditors of specified Iraqi debtors, including Rafidain, where claims arose before 6 August 1990.
In May 2006, Iraq issued an invitation to tender claims for cash purchase and for exchange.
Thereafter Iraq took assignments of certain debts owed to Rafidains creditors by Rafidain in accordance with the IDRO Scheme.
On 3 April 2008, a scheme of arrangement for the distribution of assets held by the Provisional Liquidators to Rafidains creditors was sanctioned (the Scheme).
By 19 August 2009, Iraq had submitted claims in the Scheme which were admitted in the sum of US$253.8 million (the Admitted Claims).
The original commercial debts constituting the Admitted Claims were acquired by Iraq by way of assignment from existing creditors of Rafidain.
On 4 November 2009, SerVaas obtained an order registering the Judgment in England and Wales against the Ministry under the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (the Registration Order).
It was served on Iraq on 2 May 2010 and became enforceable against the Ministry and Iraq in England and Wales on 2 September 2010.
On 11 October 2010 Iraqs US lawyers responded to a request from the Scheme Administrators by stating that the dividend payment on the Admitted Claims should be paid to the account in the name of the DFI with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
As at November 2010, the debt due in respect of the Judgment is said to have amounted to US$34,481,200.49.
In the meantime on 7 October 2010 Mann J granted an application by SerVaas lifting the stay on proceedings against Rafidain and made an order preventing Rafidain, the Provisional Liquidators and the Scheme Administrators from making any payment to Iraq under the Scheme in respect of the Admitted Claims or recognising or giving effect to any assignment or transfer of the Admitted Claimant to a third party which would have the effect of reducing the amount payable to Iraq to an amount less than the Judgment debt.
On 13 October 2010 SerVaas issued an application for a Third Party Debt Order, that is, an order that the debts payable to Iraq by Rafidain by way of dividend under the Scheme be instead paid to SerVaas insofar as necessary to satisfy the Judgment.
On 30 November 2010, the Charg dAffaires and Head of Mission of the Embassy of Iraq in London signed a certificate (the Certificate) that the Admitted Scheme Claims have never been used, are not in use and are not intended to be for use for any commercial purpose.
Iraq applied to discharge the injunction on the ground that monies due to Iraq by Rafidain were immune from execution by virtue of section 13(2)(b) of the State Immunity Act 1978.
In the High Court, Arnold J held that the Admitted Claims were immune from execution by reason of s.13(2)(b) and (4) because they were not property which was for the time being in use or intended for use for commercial purposes.
By a majority, the Court of Appeal dismissed SerVaas appeal.
SerVaas appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Whether property is for the time being in use or intended for use for commercial purposes within the meaning of s.13(4) of the State Immunity Act 1978 does not depend on whether that property has in the past been used for commercial purposes.
Lord Clarke gives the leading judgment with which Lord Phillips, Lady Hale, Lord Sumption and Lord Reed agree.
It was common ground that (a) the monies payable under the Scheme are a debt and a chose in action and as such are property within the meaning of s.13(2)(b); (b) that Iraqs state intention is to transfer the proceeds of the Admitted Claims to the DFI; (c) that, the Certificate creates a rebuttable presumption that the Admitted Claims are not in use or intended for use for commercial purposes; (d) that the onus lies on SerVaas to show a real prospect that it can rebut that presumption; and (e) that the debts were intended for use for sovereign and not commercial purposes.
As these are summary proceedings, the issue is whether there is any real prospect of SerVaas rebutting the presumption.
The central question in this appeal is therefore whether the nature of the origin of the debts is relevant to the question whether the property in question was in use for commercial purposes.
It is not.
This conclusion is based on the language of s.13(4) and on previously decided domestic and comparative authority.
As to language, s.13(4) should be given its ordinal and natural meaning having regard to its context and it would not be an ordinary use of language to say that a debt arising from a transaction is in use for that transaction.
Parliament did not intend a retrospective analysis of all the circumstances which gave rise to property but an assessment of the use to which the state had chosen to put the property.
The language of s.13(4) can also be contrasted with other sections of the Act.
As to authority, Lord Diplock in Alstom v Republic of Columbia [1984] AC 580 distinguished between the origin of the funds on the one hand and the use of them on the other.
Various decisions of the American Federal courts of appeals and of the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong also support this distinction.

uksc-2012-0234,"This appeal relates to disputes which have arisen within a Sikh sect associated with three Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Bradford, Birmingham and High Wycombe.
It raises two questions concerning the trusts on which the Gurdwaras are held.
The questions are (i) the extent to which it is open to trustees to alter, or restrict, the terms of the trusts upon which they hold property, and (ii) the extent to which the court can and should refuse to determine issues of religion or religious belief in legal proceedings.
In April 1987, fourteen men attended a meeting at which they decided to establish a Gurdwara under the guardianship of His Holiness Brahamgiani, revered 108 Sant Maharaj Baba Gian Sing Ji of Nirmal Kitia Johal.
His Holiness was the then holder of the office of Holy Saint (the First Holy Saint), the religious head of the abode of saints at Nirmal Kutia in the Indian village of Johal.
The next month a further meeting decided that this Gurdwara, which was to be similar to a Gurdwara which had been acquired in Bradford in 1982, be established under the Supreme Authority of the First Holy Saint.
In September 1987 the First Holy Saint approved a property at Oldbury, Birmingham (the Birmingham Gurdwara), which was purchased with a combination of donations from devotees and loans.
The First Holy Saint gave the responsibility of managing the Birmingham Gurdwara to the first, second and third respondents (the original trustees), to whom the Birmingham Gurdwara was then transferred.
In January 1991 the original trustees executed a Deed of Trust (the 1991 Deed), in which they declared themselves to be the trustees of a religious organisation preaching and practicing the Sikh faith and following the teachings of the First Holy Saint (the Society).
Clause 5 of the 1991 Deed (clause 5) empowered the Saint or his successor to remove the Birmingham trustees and appoint new trustees.
A month later the constitution of the Society was signed, Clause 10 of which stated that only the First Holy Saint or his successor could make changes to the Societys management committee.
In September 1993, a property was acquired at High Wycombe (the Wycombe Gurdwara) and transferred to the sixth and eight appellants and the first and sixth respondents, who were declared to hold the property in accordance with the Societys constitution.
In November 2001, the First Holy Saint died and was succeeded by Sant Harbhajan Ji, who died a few months later in March 2002.
In July 2003, at a joint meeting of the management committees of the three Gurdwaras, Sant Jeet Singh was recognised as the Third Holy Saint.
Following the respondents refusal to execute a new trust deed, Sant Jeet Singh purported to remove them as trustees and replace them with the second eighth appellants.
The appellants issued proceedings in the High Court seeking various heads of relief, including removal of the first, second, third and fourth respondents as Birmingham trustees and the removal of the fifth and sixth respondents as Wycombe trustees.
The respondents sought to strike out the claim on the ground that it was unjusticiable.
Judge Cooke dismissed the application, but the Court of Appeal allowed the respondents appeal, holding that the issue turned on religious beliefs which were not justiciable by the English courts.
The appellants now appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
The judgment is given by Lord Neuberger, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge, with whom Lord Mance and Lord Clarke agree.
The issues should all go to trial.
Depending on the facts, the powers of the respondents as trustees may have extended to agreeing a provision such as clause 5, and in any event they may not be entitled to challenge its validity.
Further, while courts do not adjudicate on the truths of religious beliefs, the courts have jurisdiction to determine disputes over the ownership, possession and control of property held on trusts for religious purposes.
During argument four issues emerged as likely to be in dispute: 1) Whether, as the appellants contend, clause 5 is valid insofar as it accords the power to appoint and dismiss trustees on persons other than the First Holy Saint; 2) If the appellants are right on the first issue, whether the reference to the successor of the First Holy Saint in clause 5 is to be read as limited to Sant Harbhajan Ji, the immediate successor to the First Holy Saint, or whether it extended to subsequent successors; 3) If the appellants are right on the first and second issues, whether Sant Jeet Singh is indeed successor to the First Holy Saint; and 4) Whether Sant Jeet Singh has departed from the tenets of mainstream Sikhism and is on character grounds unfit to be the successor [19].
The first issue: was clause 5 of the 1991 Deed invalid? In Attorney General v Mathieson [1907] 2 Ch 383, the Court of Appeal held that where a charitable trust is initially created by donors in general or vague terms, it is open to the trustee to execute a more specific deed which limits the terms of the trust, provided it does not conflict with the terms on which the donors made their donations [26].
Where the principle in Mathieson applies, it would appear that trustees must have the power to include new provisions in the trust deed which they would not normally have the power to impose in the case of a fully constituted trust [33].
It is at least arguable that, where the terms of a trust are so sparse that the trustees have implied authority on behalf of the donors to declare the trusts to which the sums contributed are to be subject, that authority extends to including a provision such as clause 5.
It would not be right to resolve this issue at an interlocutory stage for a number of reasons, including the fact that the issue has not been fully pleaded, the parties arguments have changed as the proceedings progressed, the various points have not been fully considered in the courts below, and the resolution of this issue is very likely to be fact sensitive [33 34].
The second issue: the meaning of successor On the face of the 1991 Deed, it appears that, as a matter of language, his successor could be limited to the immediate next Holy Saint, or could extend to each successive Holy Saint.
It would not be right to resolve this second issue at this interlocutory stage for much the same reasons given in relation to the first issue [36].
The third and fourth issues: non justiciability generally The term non justiciability refers to a case where an issue is inherently unsuitable for judicial determination by reason only of its subject matter.
Such cases generally fall into one of two categories.
The first category comprises cases where the issue in question is beyond the constitutional competence assigned to the courts.
Once the forbidden area is identified, the court may not adjudicate on the matters within it, even if it is necessary to do so in order to decide some other issue which is itself justiciable.
A paradigm case is the non justiciability of proceedings in Parliament [41 42].
The second category comprises cases based neither on private legal rights or obligations, nor on reviewable matters of public law.
These issues are non justiciable if the court were asked to decide them in the abstract; however, such issues must nevertheless be resolved if their resolution is necessary in order to decide some other issue which is in itself justiciable [43].
The third and fourth issues: religious doctrine The courts do not normally adjudicate on the truths of religious beliefs or on the validity of particular rites.
But where a claimant asks the court to enforce private rights and obligations which depend on religious issues, the judge may have to determine such religious issues as are capable of objective assessment [45].
The courts have jurisdiction to determine dispute over the ownership, possession and control of property held on trusts for religious purposes.
Where people set up a trust to govern the purposes for which property is to be acquired and held, they are performing a juridical act which creates interests that the civil law will protect [49].
"," disputes have arisen within a Sikh sect associated with three Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Bradford, Birmingham and High Wycombe. It raises two questions concerning the trusts on which the Gurdwara are held.

uksc-2012-0128,"Section 31 (2) of the Children Act 1989 imposes a threshold which must be satisfied before a care or supervision order can be made in respect of a child.
First the child must have suffered or be likely to suffer significant harm; secondly, that harm must be attributable to the care given or likely to be given to the child.
If the threshold is crossed then the court will treat the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration when deciding whether to make an order.
The issue in this case is whether a child can be regarded as likely to suffer harm if another child has been harmed in the past and there is a possibility that the parent now caring for him or her was responsible for the harm to the other child.
The local authority in this case brought care proceedings in respect of three children who are cared for by DJ and JJ.
The two oldest are the children of DJ and his former partner, and have always lived with DJ.
The youngest child is JJs daughter, her third child with her former partner, SW.
The local authority submitted that the three children were likely to suffer significant harm because JJs first child with SW, T J, had died of non accidental injuries in 2004.
In earlier care proceedings relating to JJ and SWs second child, who was subsequently adopted, a judge had found that either JJ or SW had caused the injuries to T J and the other had at the very least colluded to hide the truth.
In the present proceedings the local authority sought to rely solely on the finding that JJ was a possible perpetrator of the injuries to T J.
It submitted that this was a finding of fact sufficient as a matter of law to satisfy the s 31(2) threshold in respect of the three children now cared for by JJ and DJ.
The High Court held on a preliminary issue that likelihood of significant harm can only be established by reference to past facts that are proved on the balance of probabilities.
Mere possibility was insufficient.
The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the local authority but granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the local authoritys appeal.
The main judgment is given by Lady Hale, with whom all the justices agree.
Lord Wilson expresses disagreement on one point, which Lord Sumption shares.
Lord Reed gives an additional judgment, with which Lord Clarke and Lord Carnwath agree.
Lord Hope agrees with Lady Hale and Lord Reed.
It is a serious matter for the state compulsorily to remove a child from his family of birth.
The section 31(2) threshold is an important measure to protect a family from unwarranted intrusion while at the same time protecting children from harm [1] [75].
The wording of Section 31(2) has been the subject of six appeals to the House of Lords and Supreme Court.
Those cases have consistently held that a prediction of future harm has to be founded on proven facts: suspicions or possibilities are not enough.
Such facts have to be proved on the simple balance of probabilities [36].
This approach is supported by the legislative history of section 31(2) [45 46] [96].
It would be odd if the first limb (actual harm) had to be proved to the courts satisfaction but the basis of predicting future harm did not [47].
Care cases in which the only matter upon which the authority can rely is the possibility that the parent has harmed another child in the past are very rare.
Usually there will be many readily provable facts upon which an authority can rely [5].
Even in cases where the perpetrator of injuries could not be identified there may be a multitude of established facts from which a likelihood that this parent will harm a child in the future could be shown.
However, the real possibility that the parent caring for the child has harmed a child in the past is not by itself sufficient [54].
In this case there were many potentially relevant facts found in the earlier proceedings against JJ which might have been relevant to an assessment of whether JJ would harm children in the future, such as the collusion with SW which prevented the court from identifying the perpetrator, the failure to protect T J, and the deliberate failure to keep T J away from health professionals [56].
Other relevant matters for the assessment would have been consideration of the household circumstances at the time of T Js death and whether JJs new relationship with DJ looking after much older children was different [53].
As the local authority had chosen not to rely on these facts, however, it would not be fair to the whole family to allow these proceedings to go on.
JJ has been looking after these three children and a new baby for some time without (so far as the court is aware) giving cause for concern and, should the local authority wish to make a case that any of these children is likely to suffer significant harm in the future, it will be open to it to bring new proceedings [57].
Lord Wilson, while agreeing with Lady Hale for the most part and in the disposal of the appeal, identified an issue on which he differed from the majority.
In his view, since the consignment of a person to a pool of possible perpetrators of injuries to one child could not constitute a factual foundation for a prediction of likely significant harm to another child in his or her care, then as a matter of logic, it could not become part of the requisite foundation in combination with other facts and circumstances [80].
Lord Sumption agreed [92].

uksc-2012-0112,"This appeal concerns a particular application of settled principles which delineate the circumstances in which an appellate court may interfere with findings of fact made by a judge sitting at first instance.
The Appellant (DM) and first Respondent (RM) are father and son respectively.
DM and his wife left Scotland many years ago to live in the United States.
RM and his partner (LG), who is the second Respondent, live in Scotland with their son.
The Appellant and his wife decided to return to Scotland in 2005 when the latter became terminally ill.
DM asked RM, who is a property developer, to find a suitable property for him and his wife to live in upon their return.
When RM did so, DM transferred the funds required to purchase that property (the St Helens Gardens property) to RMs bank account.
RM subsequently arranged the purchase.
However, unknown to DM, he arranged for the title to the property to be taken in his own name.
DM moved into the property with his wife on 1 January 2006, but she died six days later.
In February 2007, DM gave RM a cheque in his favour for 285,000, the reason for which is subject to the dispute which gives rise to this appeal.
RM and LG used 200,000 from that amount, together with 90,000 raised by way of a mortgage, to buy a newly built house in Stewarton (the Lochrig Court property), taking title in their own names.
The remainder of the 285,000 was spent on cars, the repayment of debts, improvement of their existing home prior to sale and finishings for the Lochrig Court property.
DM raised the present proceedings later in 2007 seeking, among other remedies, the conveyance of the two properties to him.
He maintained that, first, RM had acted without his authority in taking title to the St Helens Gardens property in his own name and, second, that RM and LG had acted without his authority in taking title to the Lochrig Court property in their names.
In relation to the former, RM maintained that DM had instructed that title to the St Helens Gardens property was to be taken in his (RMs) name.
In relation to the latter, RM and LG maintained that the payment of 285,000 had been a gift.
The case proceeded to proof before the Lord Ordinary, Lord Brodie, in the Outer House of the Court of Session, who found in favour of DM and ordered that the properties be transferred to him.
It was central to the Lord Ordinarys decision that he preferred the evidence of DM over that of RM on the central issues of fact, finding that DM had not made substantial gifts to RM.
RM and LG appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session in relation to the Lochrig Court property only.
Noting that the Lord Ordinary had stated that he did not find any of the other evidence materially to undermine DMs account, the Inner House identified a number of aspects of the evidence which they asserted did exactly that.
They therefore concluded that they were entitled to overturn the Lord Ordinarys decision on the basis that he had gone plainly wrong and to substitute their own decision on the facts from the printed record of proceedings.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows DMs appeal.
Lord Reed gives the judgment of the court.
The Inner House considered that eight separate aspects of the evidence had undermined DMs evidence [24].
However, of these, only four were of substance [25 26], and each of those had been expressly taken into account by the Lord Ordinary in reaching his conclusion on DMs credibility [27].
In a case such as the present one, in which the trial judge is faced with a stark choice between irreconcilable accounts, the credibility of the parties testimony is of primary importance.
In that regard, the Lord Ordinary found that DM was a credible witness on the central issue of whether the payment of 285,000 was a gift, notwithstanding a number of aspects of the evidence which could be regarded as detracting from his credibility [28, 30].
The question whether DMs evidence was to be regarded as credible and reliable, having regard to the other evidence in the case, was pre eminently a matter for the Lord Ordinary [28].
Further, the Inner House did not consider the weight of the evidence adverse to DMs credibility in the context of the evidence as a whole.
They did not appear to have given any weight to the extent to which the Lord Ordinarys conclusion was affected by the manner in which the witnesses gave evidence, which the Inner House could not have assessed for themselves from the printed record.
They did not consider the Lord Ordinarys assessment of the character of the witnesses or the unchallenged finding that RM had acted in breach of trust in relation to the St Helens Gardens property.
They also did not scrutinise the evidence of RM or LG in the same way they did that of DM [29].
It was not correct for the Inner House to rely on the case of Hamilton v Allied Domecq plc [2007] UKHL 33, in which a critical finding of fact had been made which was unsupported by the evidence.
That was not the position in the present case [31].
Finally, in relation to the issues raised on the appeal, the Lord Ordinarys assessment that the evidence of the Respondents son added little or nothing on the basis that he largely recounted what he had been told by his parents, was borne out by the relevant passages of the evidence.
The Lord Ordinary did not therefore err in failing to give greater weight to that evidence [32].
In the whole circumstances, therefore, the Inner House had no proper basis for concluding that the Lord Ordinary had gone plainly wrong, let alone that on a re consideration of the whole evidence the opposite conclusion should be reached [33].
While the case concerned the application of long settled legal principles, the Court does not criticise the bringing of the appeal.
The failure of an appellate court to apply those principles correctly may raise a point of law of general public importance [35].
",This appeal concerns a particular application of settled principles which delineate the circumstances in which an appellate court may interfere with findings of fact made by a judge sitting at first instance.

uksc-2009-0074,"This appeal concerns the effectiveness of a scheme (Project C) which was designed to minimise the liability to VAT of a group of companies (Oriel) involved in providing motor breakdown insurance (MBI).
The supply of insurance is exempt from VAT.
Insurers therefore neither charge VAT on premiums nor account to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (the Commissioners) for VAT in respect of their insurance business.
They also bear the VAT element of the costs incurred in the course of their business which are chargeable to VAT, as they may not deduct that VAT element from any VAT that they have received.
Accordingly when an MBI insurer indemnifies an insured against the cost of repairs, the insurer may not deduct the VAT element of the repairing garages invoice.
The VAT paid to garages by MBI insurers represents a substantial business cost.
They perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage relative to competitors whose business is not exempt from VAT, and who can therefore offer car repair services and deduct the VAT element of the costs incurred as input tax.
Project C sought to remedy that disadvantage by enabling one or other member of Oriel to recover the VAT element of the repair costs.
NIG is a UK insurer which provides a UK front for an offshore MBI business carried on by Oriel.
NIGs policies cover the cost of repairs and replacement parts following breakdowns of second hand cars.
The policies are marketed and sold by another UK company (Warranty), which is a member of the Oriel group.
Prior to the implementation of Project C, NIG reinsured the risk under the policies with a Gibraltar based member of Oriel (Practical).
Warranty was appointed by NIG to handle claims made under the policies.
In the event of a breakdown, the insured contacted Warranty and was directed to a garage approved by Warranty, a garage of the insureds choice or the dealer garage.
Warranty paid for the repairs carried out by the garages.
The VAT on such payments was irrecoverable.
Project C attempted to solve that problem.
It consisted of two strands.
The first was based on legislation interpreted by those responsible for Project C as enabling UK insurance claims handlers to recover input tax incurred for the purpose of supplying their services to a non EU recipient.
WHA Ltd (WHA), a UK member of the Oriel group, therefore began to supply claims handling services to Viscount Reinsurance Company Ltd (Viscount), a member of the group based in Gibraltar, and therefore outside the EU, with which 85% of the risk under NIGs MBI policies was reinsured.
The intention was that WHA would be regarded as the recipient of a supply of repair services from the garages on which VAT would be charged; would not have to charge output tax on its onwards supply of claims handling services to Viscount as the latter was outside the EU; and as a result would be entitled to recover input tax from the Commissioners under the legislation.
The second strand of Project C was a fall back line of defence designed to deal with any assertion by the Commissioners that the second stage of the first strand, namely that VAT was not chargeable on WHAs supply of claims handling services to Viscount, was incorrect.
That conclusion would render the first strand ineffective.
On the basis of legislation which was interpreted as enabling Viscount to recover the VAT which it paid to WHA so long as Viscount itself made supplies to a non EU recipient, another Gibraltar based member of the Oriel group (Crystal) was installed to reinsure 100% of the risk under NIGs MBI policies, and in turn
to retrocede 85% of that risk to Viscount.
Notably, the second strand also proceeded on the basis that WHA would be regarded as the recipient of a supply of repair services from the garages.
The Commissioners refused to repay tax to WHA and Viscount for several reasons that pertained to either the first, second or both strands of Project C.
In particular, they argued that the garages did not in fact make a taxable supply of services to WHA, a conclusion that would vitiate both strands.
They also argued that even if they were wrong in that and other arguments, Project C was so artificial that it fell foul of the EU law doctrine of the abuse of rights.
The Court of Appeal held that the garages did make a taxable supply to WHA, that the first strand of Project C was ineffective for other reasons, but that under the second strand Viscount was entitled to recover the VAT it had paid to WHA, subject to the question of abuse of rights.
It subsequently held that the scheme was a breach of the abuse of rights doctrine.
WHA and Viscount appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that WHA does receive a taxable supply from the garages and that Project C is not a breach of the abuse of rights doctrine.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Reed gives the judgment of the Court.
For the reasons summarised below, the Supreme Court holds that there is no supply of repair services by the garages to WHA.
It is therefore unnecessary for the Court to address the other issues raised, as both strands of Project C were predicated on the conclusion that there was such a supply [18].
Decisions about the application of the VAT system are highly fact sensitive.
When determining the relevant supply in which a taxable person engages, regard must be had to all the circumstances in which a transaction takes place.
In cases involving a construct of contractual relationships, the matter must be assessed as a whole to determine the economic reality.
The transaction between the garages and WHA must be understood in the context of the wider arrangements between the insured, NIG, Crystal, Viscount, WHA and the garage [26].
Having regard, therefore, to the agreements between NIG and the insured, NIG and Crystal, Crystal and Viscount, and Viscount and WHA, the terms of each contract envisage the role of WHA as encompassing the negotiation, investigation, adjustment, settlement and payment of claims.
There is no indication that WHAs role included undertaking responsibility for the carrying out of repairs [33].
Further, the nature of the relationship between the garages and WHA does not suggest that the former provides a service to the latter [35 38].
NIG undertakes to the insured to meet the cost of repairs to a vehicle falling within the scope of the policy.
It does not undertake responsibility for the repairs themselves [27, 56].
The economic reality is that the payments made by WHA to the garages merely discharge the obligation which NIG undertook to the insured to pay for the repair of a vehicle up to the value permitted by the policy in the event of a breakdown.
The interposition of Viscount and Crystal in the chain of contracts linking WHA to NIG does not alter the position that WHA simply acts as the paymaster of the costs falling within the cover provided by the policies [56 57].
That conclusion is supported by further considerations.
First, the deduction of input tax is meant to relieve the trader in question of the VAT payable or paid in the course of his economic activities.
However, WHAs own profit and loss is unaffected by VAT as it pays the garages out of a float provided by Viscount.
Secondly, the consequence of input tax deduction should be that VAT is only borne on the supply to the final consumer.
The effect of dismissing this appeal is that VAT is borne on the supply of services by the garage to the final consumer, namely the insured [58].

uksc-2010-0147,"These two joined appeals raise the question of whether a property used wholly for commercial purposes may qualify as a house for the purposes of legislation governing the right to leasehold enfranchisement (i.e. the right of a lessee in certain circumstances compulsorily to acquire the freehold of the building from his/her landlord) [1].
In the Hosebay case, the respondents owned the leases of three buildings in central London which had originally been built as separate houses as part of a late Victorian terrace [10].
The leases restricted the use of the houses to use for residential purposes, but on the date when the respondent served notices on the appellants under s.8 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (the 1967 Act) seeking compulsorily to acquire the freehold of the buildings, they were being used wholly as a self catering hotel [10,13].
In the Lexgorge case, the respondent owned the lease of a five storey building in central London also originally built as a house [16].
The terms of the lease restricted the use of the upper two floors of the building to residential flats [18].
On the date when the respondent served a notice under s.8 of the 1967 Act, the building was used wholly for office purposes [17].
The building was listed as a building of special architectural or historic interest, and English Heritages records described it as a terraced house [18].
The issue in both appeals was whether the properties constituted houses within the meaning of s.2(1) of the 1967 Act.
This raised two separate but overlapping questions: (i) Were the buildings designed or adapted for living in? (ii) Were they houses reasonably so called? [8] Both elements of the definition were disputed by the appellants in the Hosebay case, but only second element of the definition was disputed by the appellant in the Lexgorge case [8].
The judge at first instance in each case concluded that the buildings were houses for the purposes the 1967 Act, and the Court of Appeal reluctantly upheld those decisions [1,2].
The Supreme Court unanimously allows both appeals.
It holds that neither property constituted a house for the purposes of the 1967 Act on the date when the relevant statutory notice was served.
The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Carnwath.
The decision of the Court of Appeal was not the result intended by Parliament when, pursuant to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, it removed the requirements of residence from the 1967 Act [3 5].
As far as possible, an interpretation of the 1967 Act which has the effect of conferring rights on lessees going beyond those which Parliament intended to confer should be avoided [6].
The first element of the definition of house in s.2(1) of the 1967 Act (i.e. designed or adapted for living in) looks to the identity or function of the building based on its physical characteristics, the second element (i.e. a house reasonably so called) ties the definition to the primary meaning of house as a single residence, as opposed to, for example, a hostel or a block of flats [9].
Both parts of the definition need to be read in the context of a statute which is about houses as places to live in, not about houses as pieces of architecture or features in a street scene [9].
As to the first part of the definition of house in s.2(1) of the 1967 Act, the words designed and adapted do not constitute alternative qualifying requirements, despite the literal meaning of the provision [34].
Context and common sense argue strongly against a definition turning principally on historic design, if that has long been superseded by adaptation to some other use [34].
The words is adapted in s.2(1) refer to the present state of the building and do not imply any particular degree of structural change [34,35].
As to the second part of the definition, the external and internal physical appearance of a building should not be treated as determinative of whether it is a house reasonably so called , nor should the terms of the lease be treated as a major factor [41].
The buildings in the Hosebay case were not houses reasonably so called [43].
The fact that they might look like houses and might be referred to as houses for some purposes was not sufficient to displace the fact that their use was entirely commercial [43].
It was unnecessary to decide whether the buildings were designed or adapted for living in [44].
The building in the Lexgorge case was also not a house reasonably so called because it was used wholly for office purposes [45].
The fact that it was designed as a house and is still described as a house for many purposes (such as architectural histories) was beside the point [45].
","Two joined appeals raise the question of whether a property used wholly for commercial purposes may qualify as a house for the purposes of legislation governing the right to leasehold enfranchisement.

uksc-2018-0117,"This appeal is about who should pay the legal costs of 426 claimants who successfully sued a medical group for the supply of defective silicone breast implants.
It allows the Supreme Court to review the principles concerning third party costs orders. 623 claims were brought against Transform Medical Group (CS) Ltd (Transform), a medical clinic which had supplied implants manufactured by Poly Implant Prothse (PIP).
Transform had insurance cover with Travelers Insurance Co Ltd (Travelers) in relation to claims brought against it.
Travelers funded the whole of Transforms defence.
It did not disclose until a relatively late stage that a substantial number of claimants were uninsured.
The insurance policy only covered the claims of 197 claimants who suffered from a rupture of their implants between 31 March 2007 and 30 March 2011.
Transform was uninsured in respect of the claims of the remaining 426 claimants.
The uninsured claimants are the Respondents to this appeal.
Transform entered insolvent administration half way through the litigation.
The insured claims were settled by an agreement made in August 2015 and Travelers paid an agreed proportion of the damages and costs attributable to those insured claims.
This left the insured claimants in a much better position than the uninsured claimants who had obtained a judgment but recovered no damages or costs from Transform at all.
The 426 uninsured claimants applied to the court for an order that Travelers pay their costs.
Lady Justice Thirlwall, sitting in the High Court, held that Travelers should be ordered to pay them.
The Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Patten) reached the same conclusion for slightly different reasons.
Travelers appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows Travelers appeal.
Lord Briggs gives the main judgment, with which Lady Black and Lord Kitchin agree.
Lord Reed and Lord Sumption each give a concurring judgment.
The court has a general power to order non parties to pay costs under section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 [25] [26].
In the context of liability insurance, it is important for the courts to apply clear and reasonably detailed principles so that liability insurers can understand their position.
It is not enough for the courts to ask whether the case is exceptional because this would not provide adequate certainty [33]; [51].
Broadly speaking, the authorities reveal two approaches to deciding whether a third party should pay costs: (1) whether the third party took control of the litigation and became the real defendant; and (2) whether the third party engaged in unjustified intermeddling.
The real defendant test, as explained by the Court of Appeal in TGA Chapman Ltd v Christopher [1998] 1 WLR 12, provides useful guidelines for cases where insurance exists but some part of the claim (including the claim for costs) lies outside the limits of cover [48] [53].
However, it is inappropriate in cases like this where the claims are wholly uninsured [54].
In such cases, the appropriate question is whether the insurer engaged in unjustified intermeddling in litigation to which it was not a party.
If the insurer has acted within a framework of contractual obligation, it may be very hard to establish that it has intermeddled [55] [56]; [78].
It will usually be necessary to establish a causative link between the insurers involvement and the claimants incurring of costs [65] [67]; [80].
In this case, all the claims were pursued within a single group action by common solicitors.
They involved common issues which were being tried together in four test claims (which, as it turned out, comprised two insured and two uninsured claims) [68]; [79].
Travelers had a legitimate interest in Transforms defence of the insured claims and, consequently, in Transforms defence of the test cases and common issues.
Travelers involvement was the natural result of its status as an insurer and did not amount to unjustified intermeddling [69].
The courts below relied on a number of specific instances of Travelers conduct.
However, none of them crossed the line into unjustified intermeddling: (1) Non disclosure of the limits of cover.
Travelers and Transforms solicitors advised Transform not to disclose the limits of its insurance cover.
However, as the law stands, parties are not legally obliged to disclose the details of their insurance [59].
The advice about non disclosure fairly reflected Travelers rights relating to the insured claims [63] [64]; [81]. (2) Offers and admissions.
Travelers was involved in Transforms decisions not to make offers of settlement or admissions to the uninsured claimants [70] [71].
If necessary, the court would conclude this involvement was justified but in any event, it did not cause the claimants to incur costs.
By 2015 the uninsured claimants were determined to pursue their claims to a judgment with costs, and an offer to settle without paying their costs would have made no difference [73] [74]. (3) Asymmetry of risk.
The Court of Appeal was concerned by the fact that the uninsured claimants faced failing to recover their costs if they won, whereas Transform could have recovered its costs if they had failed [58].
However, this asymmetry was not the product of Travelers intervention.
It resulted from the fact that Transform was insolvent and largely uninsured, and the claimants liability for costs was several only (i.e. each claimant was independently liable for a small proportion of the overall costs) [61] [62]; [82].
Therefore, the courts below were wrong to order Travelers to pay the uninsured claimants costs [83].
Concurring judgments of Lord Reed and Lord Sumption Lord Reed reviews the historical position in England, Australia and New Zealand relating to third party costs orders [85] [93]; [106] [112] and compares this to Scotland, where the courts may order
expenses against a third party who has acted as the real master of the litigation, and where there is no equivalent concept to intermeddling [94] [103].
Lord Reed adds that the suggestion that a costs order must be exceptional has little, if any, significance [106] [112].
Lord Sumption discusses the intermeddling and real defendant approaches.
He suggests that cases in which an insurer has engaged in intermeddling are likely to be rare, and an insurer who acts in good faith in relation to insured claims should not incur liability in costs [113] [116].

The fourth appellant, Halligen (H), is a British citizen whose extradition is sought to the USA under Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003 (the Act) to face allegations of wire fraud and money laundering.
All four appellants were arrested and brought before Westminster Magistrates Court.
L, P and Rs extradition were ordered on (respectively) 28th January 2011, 2nd March 2011 and 4th March 2011.
Hs case was sent to the Secretary of State for her to decide whether H should be extradited.
On 22nd December 2010, Hs extradition was ordered by the Secretary of State, and the order and a letter setting out the Secretary of States reasons were sent by post and fax (at either 15.48 or 16.48) to Hs solicitors on that same day.
All four appellants were remanded in custody at HMP Wandsworth pending extradition.
The permitted time period for giving notice of appeal against an extradition order was 7 days in the case of L, P and R, and 14 days in the case of H. L, P and R were each assisted by a prison officer working in the legal services department at HMP Wandsworth to complete a notice of appeal.
The legal services department faxed the notices of appeal to the Administrative Court for filing and stamping, which faxed back a copy of the sealed front page to the legal services department.
The legal services department then faxed to the Crown Prosecution Services (CPS), as legal representatives of the judicial authority of the state requesting surrender, a copy of the sealed front page together with a cover sheet.
In the case of each of L, P and R, all this occurred within the 7 day permitted period.
However, in each case, the CPS was not served with a full copy of the notice of appeal, sealed or unsealed, until after the 7 day time limit had expired.
The High Court held it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeals.
A notice of appeal had to be both filed and served within the non extendable permitted period, and must (a) identify the appellant, (b) identify the decision against which he seeks to appeal, and (c) set out at least the gist of the basis on which the appeal is sought to be presented.
Accordingly, the purported notices of appeal were invalidly constituted and served out of time.
Hs solicitors prepared a notice of appeal, attaching grounds of appeal, on 23rd December 2010.
The notice of appeal was filed and stamped on 29th December 2011, well within the 14 day permitted period which expired at midnight on 4th January 2011.
However, only on 5th January 2011 did Hs solicitors send the notice of appeal to the CPS by fax and to the Home Office by post (reaching the latter on 6th January 2011).
H himself had written from prison by fax to the Home Office on 29th December 2010 asking them to accept the letter as notice & service of my intent to appeal that decision and stating that he had instructed solicitors for that purpose.
The High Court held it had no jurisdiction to hear Hs appeal, that Hs letter of 29th December 2011 did not constitute a valid notice of appeal, and the Secretary of State should be treated as having informed H of her decision on 22nd
December, not 23rd December, 2011, so that the purported notice of appeal was in any event served out of time.
All four appellants appealed the decisions of the High Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court allows all four appeals unanimously.
Lord Mance gives the leading judgment of the Court.
Lady Hale gives a separate concurring judgment.
The requirement under the Act that a notice of an appeal be given within the relevant permitted period meant that it had to be filed in the High Court and served on all respondents to the appeal within such period (following the decision of the House of Lords in Mucelli v Government of Albania [2009] UKHL 2) [5], [17].
However, a generous view should be taken of this requirement, bearing in mind the shortness of the permitted periods under the Act and that what really matters is that an appeal should have been filed and that all respondents be on notice of this, sufficient to warn them that they should not proceed with extradition pending an appeal [18].
In the cases of L, P and R, the irregularity involved in the absence of pages following the sealed front page of their notices of appeal was capable of cure.
The CPS, having received in time the sealed front page of each notice of appeal, can have had no difficulty in identifying the decisions being appealed.
It would be disproportionate if the practice followed by the court and the prison legal services department should lead to the appellants losing their right of appeal [19].
The Court regards Hs letter as notice to the Secretary of State of an appeal within the Act, albeit that the letter was highly irregular in its form [20].
However, even if it is accepted that Hs solicitors only received the relevant fax from the Secretary of State at 16.48, there was no basis for deeming the fax to have been received the following day.
It follows that no notice of an appeal was given to the CPS within the permitted period, and Hs appeal is on its face impermissible as against both respondents [21].
In these circumstances, the question for the Court is whether the apparently inflexible time limits for appeals within the Act are subject to any qualification or exception [22].
Under Article 6(1) of the Human Rights Convention, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him.
The Court is satisfied that extradition does not involve the determination of a criminal charge [31].
However, H, as a UK citizen, enjoyed a civil right to enter and remain in the UK as and when he pleased [32].
Proceedings under the Act, in that they may affect Hs freedom to remain in the UK, at least for the duration of foreign extradition proceedings, involve the determination of that civil right [32].
It follows that the extradition proceedings against H fall within Article 6(1) [33].
In the case of a UK citizen, the statutory provisions concerning appeals can and should be read (pursuant to the obligation of conforming interpretation under section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998) as being subject to the qualification that the court must have a discretion in exceptional circumstances to extend time for both filing and service, where such statutory provisions would otherwise operate to prevent an appeal in a manner conflicting with the right of access to an appeal process under Article 6(1).
Accordingly, the Court allows all four appeals and remits each appeal against extradition to the High Court to be heard there [19], [41].

uksc-2009-0222,"This appeal concerns the application of the anti deprivation rule, a principle of insolvency law that contractual terms purporting to dispose of property on bankruptcy may be invalid as being in fraud or an evasion of the bankruptcy law.
This appeal arises out of the insolvency of the Lehman Brothers group, including the Appellant group company, Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc (LBSF).
The commercial context of the dispute is complicated.
In October 2002 Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (LBIE) established a synthetic debt repackaged note issuance programme, called the Dante programme.
The purpose of the Dante programme was to provide or mimic a form of credit insurance to LBSF against credit events (such as failure to pay, bankruptcy and restructuring) which occurred within the reference portfolio of obligations owed by specified reference entities (the reference portfolio).
The commercial purpose of the transaction was achieved through the issue of the so called synthetic credit linked notes by special purpose vehicles (the issuer) set up in tax friendly jurisdictions.
The investors in the notes (the noteholders), including the Respondents, were Australian local authorities, pension funds, private investment companies and private individuals.
The subscription proceeds paid by the investors for the notes were used by the issuer to purchase secure investments (the collateral) which was then vested in a trust corporation (the trustee).
In order to service the interest payments under the notes, the issuer entered into a swap agreement with LBSF under which LBSF received the income (or yield) on the collateral and, in return, paid the issuer the amount of interest due to the noteholders under the terms of the notes.
The amount by which the sum payable under the swap agreement by LBSF exceeded the yield on the collateral represented the premium for the, in effect, credit insurance provided by the noteholders.
It was further agreed that on maturity of the notes (or on early redemption or termination), LBSF would pay the issuer an amount equal to the initial principal amount subscribed by the investors less amounts calculated by reference to credit events occurring in the reference portfolio and in return would receive the sum equal to the proceeds of sale of the collateral, thereby giving effect to the insurance aspect of the programme.
To ensure LBSFs recovery, the trustee was instructed to apply all proceeds from the collateral, first, in meeting the issuers obligations to LBSF and only then in meeting the issuers obligations to the noteholders.
However, LBSF would loose its priority claim to the collateral if it was in default under the swap, triggering a change in priority in favour of the noteholders, the so called flip.
The events of default under the swap were numerous and, for present purposes, included filing for Chapter 11 protection by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (LBHI) on 15 September 2008 and by LBSF on 3 October 2008.
In reliance on the latter event, and following a direction from the noteholders, the trustee caused the issuer to terminate the swap with LBSF.
This early termination triggered the payment of unwind costs (the market assessment of the net amount either party to the swap would have received were it to run to maturity) to LBSF.
At the same time, LBSFs event of default caused the priority of claims against the collateral to change in favour of the noteholders.
Given that the issuers obligations to the noteholders and to LBSF were limited to the value of the collateral and that the total claims by the noteholders and LBSF exceeded the value of the collateral, this change in priority effectively deprived LBSF of a chance to recover its unwind costs.
As a result, LBSF sought to challenge the validity of the flip on the basis that it breached the anti deprivation principle.
LBSFs position was that its rights to the unwind costs and the priority it enjoyed over the collateral formed part of LBSFs insolvent estate of which it was deprived on change of priority following LBSFs bankruptcy.
Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal upheld the contractual arrangements.
Sir Andrew Morritt C found that the contractual provisions did not offend the anti deprivation rule; or, alternatively, that the rule was not engaged since the flip was triggered by an earlier LBHI Chapter 11 filing and thus LBSFs Chapter 11 filing did not deprive it of any property.
In the Court of Appeal, Lord Neuberger MR (with whom Longmore LJ agreed) found the flip provisions valid in reliance, to a large extent, on the fact that the collateral was acquired with money provided by the noteholders.
Patten LJ thought that the rule did not apply because a change of priority was always a feature of the security arrangements.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed LBSFs appeal and upheld the validity of contractual provisions.
The lead judgment was given by Lord Collins, with whom Lord Phillips, Lord Hope, Lord Walker, Lady Hale and Lord Clarke agreed.
Lord Mance agreed with the majoritys conclusion but for different reasons.
Issue 1 the anti deprivation rule Having examined the application of the anti deprivation rule over the last 200 years, Lord Collins held that the rule is too well established to be discarded despite the detailed provisions set out in insolvency legislation, all of which must be taken to have been enacted against the background of the anti deprivation rule: [102].
Lord Collins identified the following limits of the rule.
First, a deliberate intention to evade insolvency laws is required, although such intention need not be subjective.
Thus a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the anti deprivation rule: [78] [79].
Secondly, the anti deprivation rule does not apply if the deprivation takes place for reasons other than bankruptcy: [80].
Thirdly, the distinction between an interest determinable on bankruptcy (the so called flawed asset), which is outside the anti deprivation rule, and an absolute interest defeasible on bankruptcy by a condition subsequent, which falls foul of the rule, is too well established to be dislodged otherwise than by legislation: [87] [88].
However, not every proprietary right expressed to determine or change on bankruptcy is valid, still less a deprivation which has been provided for in the transaction from the outset: [89].
Fourthly, the source of the assets is an important element in determining whether there had been a fraud on the bankruptcy laws: [96].
However, there is no general exception to the anti deprivation rule based simply on the source of the assets: [98].
Lord Collins concluded that commercial sense and absence of intention to evade insolvency laws are highly relevant factors in the application of the anti deprivation rule and that the rule does not apply to bona fide commercial transactions which do not have as their predominant purpose, or one of their main purposes, the deprivation of the property of one of the parties on bankruptcy: [103] [104].
Since the contractual provisions challenged in the present appeal were part of a complex commercial transaction entered into in good faith, the collateral was in substance provided by the noteholders and there was no suggestion that the flip provisions were deliberately intended to evade insolvency law, they did not offend the anti deprivation rule: [108] [113].
Lord Mance agreed that the insolvency legislation has not made redundant the common law anti deprivation principle: [150] [151].
However, he would have dismissed this appeal on the basis that LBSF could not be regarded as having been deprived of any property.
On his reading of the documentation, LBSF could not be said to enjoy the contractual priority until the occurrence of certain events.
Thus once an event of default under the swap occurred, LBSF was not deprived of the priority but simply prevented from acquiring it in the first place: [168].
Even if LBSF was deprived of its property, the flip simply amounted to a contractual termination of the future reciprocal obligations of the parties, the performance of each of which is the quid pro quo of the other, and thus did not constitute an illegitimate evasion of the bankruptcy laws: [178] [180].
Issue 2 the timing of the deprivation Given the conclusion on issue 1, the question of whether LBHIs earlier bankruptcy (as argued by the Respondents) rather than LBSFs bankruptcy constituted the relevant event of default which triggered the operation of the flip did not arise.
Lord Collins would have dismissed the Appellants argument on this point: [118] [120].
Lord Mance, although sceptical of the Respondents argument, preferred not to express a view on this issue: [181] [183].
","The appeal arises out of the insolvency of the Lehman Brothers group. LBSF sought to challenge the validity of the flip on the basis that it breached the anti deprivation principle. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal upheld the contractual arrangements. The judgment was given by Lord Phillips, Lord Hope, Lord Clarke and Lord Hale.",0.07816711590296496,0.06882591093117409,0.07681940700808626,0.07547169811320754,4.616675671959839e-11
uksc-2013-0004,"This appeal arises out of proceedings for financial remedies following a divorce between Michael and Yasmin Prest.
The appeal concerns the position of a number of companies belonging to the Petrodel Group which were wholly owned and controlled by Michael Prest, the husband.
One of the companies was the legal owner of five residential properties in the UK and another was the legal owner of two more.
The question on this appeal is whether the court has power to order the transfer of these seven properties to the wife given that they legally belong not to the husband but to his companies.
Under Section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (the 1973 Act), the court may order that a party to the marriage shall transfer to the other partysuch property as may be so specified, being property to which the first mentioned party is entitled, either in possession or reversion.
In the High Court, Moylan J concluded that there was no general principle that entitled him to reach the companies assets by piercing the corporate veil.
He nevertheless concluded that a wider jurisdiction to pierce the corporate veil was available under section 24 of the 1973 Act.
In the Court of Appeal, three of the companies challenged the decision on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to order their property to be conveyed to the wife.
The majority in the Court of Appeal agreed and criticised the practice of the Family Division of treating assets of companies substantially owed by one party to a marriage as available for distribution under section 24 of the 1973 Act.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal by Yasmin Prest and declares that the seven disputed properties vested in the companies are held on trust for the husband on the ground (which was not considered by the courts below) that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the properties were held by the husbands companies on a resulting trust for the husband, and were accordingly property to which the [husband] is entitled, either in possession or reversion.
Lord Sumption gives the leading judgment and Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Clarke and Lord Walker add concurring judgments.
There are three possible legal bases on which the assets of the companies might be available to satisfy the lump sum order against the husband: (1) that this is a case where, exceptionally, the Court may disregard the corporate veil in order to give effective relief; (2) that section 24 of the 1973 Act confers a distinct power to disregard the corporate veil in matrimonial cases; or (3) that the companies hold the properties on trust for the husband, not by virtue of his status as sole shareholder and controller of the company, but in the particular circumstances of the case [9].
After surveying the authorities, the Court holds that there is a principle of English law which enables a court in very limited circumstances to pierce the corporate veil.
It applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control.
The court may then pierce the corporate veil but only for the purpose of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage which they would otherwise have obtained by the companys separate legal personality.
In most cases the facts necessary to establish this will disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller giving rise to legal or equitable rights of the controller over the companys property, thus making it unnecessary to pierce the veil.
In these cases, there is no public policy imperative justifying piercing the corporate veil.
But the recognition of a small residual category of cases where the abuse of the corporate veil to evade or frustrate the law can be addressed only by disregarding the legal personality of the company is consistent with authority and long standing principles of legal policy. [35] The principle has no application in the present case because the husbands actions did not evade or frustrate any legal obligation to his wife, nor was he concealing or evading the law in relation to the distribution of assets of the marriage upon its dissolution [36].
Some of the concurring judgments reserve the possibility of a somewhat wider test, but not in respects which affect its application to the present case.
The Court rejects the argument that a broader principle applies in matrimonial proceedings by virtue of section 24(1)(a) of the 1973 Act.
The section invokes concepts of the law of property with an established legal meaning which cannot be suspended or taken to mean something different in matrimonial proceedings [37].
Nothing in the statutory history or wording of the 1973 Act suggests otherwise [86 9].
General words in a statute are not to be read in a manner inconsistent with fundamental principles of law unless this result is required by express words or necessary implication [40].
The trial judges reasoning cut across the statutory scheme of company and insolvency law which are essential for protecting those dealing with companies [41].
It follows that the only basis on which the companies could be ordered to convey properties to the wife is that they belong beneficially to the husband, by virtue of the particular circumstances in which the properties came to be vested in them [43].
After examining the relevant findings about the acquisition of the seven disputed properties, the Court finds that the most plausible inference from the known facts was that each of the properties was held on resulting trust by the companies for the husband.
The trial judge found that the husband had deliberately sought to conceal the fact in his evidence and failed to comply with court orders with particular regard to disclosing evidence [4].
Adverse influences could therefore be drawn against him. [45].
The Court inferred that the reason for the companies failure to co operate was to protect the properties, which suggested that proper disclosure would reveal them to beneficially owned by the husband [47].
It followed that there was no reliable evidence to rebut the most plausible inference from the facts [49 51].

uksc-2011-0261,"These appeals raise questions of some significance arising out of the interrelationship of the statutory schemes relating to the protection of employees pensions and to corporate insolvency.
In order to protect employees from the adverse consequences of an under funded occupational pension scheme, the Pensions Act 2004 (the 2004 Act) introduced a financial support direction (FSD) regime.
This enables the Pensions Regulator in specified circumstances (i) to impose, by the issue of an FSD to some or all of the other group companies (known as targets), an obligation to provide reasonable financial support to the under funded scheme of the service company or insufficiently resourced employer, and (ii) to deal with non compliance with that obligation by imposing, through a Contribution Notice (a CN), a specific monetary liability payable by a target to the trustees.
Many UK registered members of the Lehman group of companies and of the Nortel group of companies have gone into insolvent administration.
One of those Lehman group companies entered into service contracts with, and ran a pension scheme for the benefit of, employees who worked for other group members.
The Nortel group included a company which had a pension scheme, and which was insufficiently resourced to fund that scheme.
The pension scheme (the Scheme) in each case was a final salary scheme, which appears to be, and to have been for some time, in substantial deficit.
The Pensions Regulator subsequently initiated machinery under the 2004 Act to require certain other group members the target companies to provide financial support for the Scheme.
That machinery has been held up so it can be decided how the administrators of a target company should treat that companys potential liability under the FSD regime (in due course the liability under a CN) in a case where the FSD is not served until after the company has gone into administration (or into insolvent liquidation).
Specifically, would the liability under such a requirement rank (a) as an expense of the targets administration, (b) pari passu (i.e. equally) with the target companies other unsecured creditors, or (c) as neither? Under option (a) the liability would rank ahead of the unsecured creditors, and may well be paid in full; under option (b) it would rank equally with those creditors; under option (c) it would rank behind them, and would probably be worthless.
Briggs J and the Court of Appeal concluded that option (b) was not open to them, and preferred option (a) to option (c).
The Supreme Court considers option (b) to be correct, and unanimously allows the appeals to the extent of declaring that a targets liability under the FSD regime, arising pursuant to an FSD issued after the company has gone into administration, ranks as a provable debt of the company, and does not rank as an expense of the administration.
Lord Neuberger gives the main judgment of the Court, with which Lord Mance, Lord Clarke and Lord Toulson agree.
Lord Sumption gives a short concurring judgment, with which Lord Mance and Lord Clarke agree.
The potential liability as a result of an FSD issued after the commencement of an administration or an insolvent liquidation (an insolvent event) can constitute a provable debt within rule 13.12 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (SI 1925/1986) (the Insolvency Rules).
Whilst the potential FSD regime liabilities in the present cases do not fall within rule 13.12(1)(a) [68] [71], they fall within rule 13.12(1)(b) [83].
It is common ground that if a CN had been issued in respect of a target before an insolvent event, it would give rise to a provable debt.
The courts below considered that, if a CN were issued after an insolvent event, it would give rise to a provable debt if it was based on an FSD issued before the insolvent event.
It appears somewhat arbitrary that the characterisation and treatment of the liability under the FSD regime should turn on when the FSD or CN happens to have been issued, if it is based on a state of affairs which existed before the insolvent event [59].
The courts below felt constrained by a consistent line of authority from reaching the conclusion the Supreme Court has reached, although it appears that they would have so held if they had felt able to do so [56].
These earlier authorities can be overruled: the judgments are very short of reasoning, are inconsistent with another line of authority, and were decided at a time when the legislature and the courts were less anxious than currently for an insolvency to clear all the liabilities of a bankrupt (as they were all concerned with individual insolvencies) [87] [94].
There is no doubt that the liability which is imposed on a target on the issuing of an FSD after an insolvent event is a liability for the purposes of rule 13.12(1)(b), as it is a liability under an enactment within rule 13.12(4).
The question is, however, whether it can be said to be a liability which arose by reason of any obligation incurred before the insolvent event [72].
That issue centres on the meaning of the word obligation in rule 13.12(1)(b) [74].
At least normally, in order for a company to have incurred a relevant obligation under rule 13.12(1)(b), it must have taken, or been subjected to, some step or combination of steps which (a) had some legal effect (such as putting it under some legal duty or into some legal relationship), and which (b) resulted in it being vulnerable to the specific liability in question, such that there would be a real prospect of that liability being incurred.
If these two requirements are satisfied, it is also relevant to consider (c) whether it would be consistent with the regime under which the liability is imposed to conclude that the step or combination of steps gave rise to an obligation under rule 13.12(1)(b) [77].
In these appeals, all these requirements are satisfied, and accordingly the relevant obligation arose before the target companies went into administration.
Given that the potential FSD liability in each of these cases is a provable debt within rule 12.3 of the Insolvency Rules, and therefore it would not be an expense, it is strictly unnecessary to consider whether the liability under an FSD served after an insolvent event would be a liquidation expense, if, as the courts below held, it was not a provable debt [97].
However, given that this issue was fully debated before the Court, and is one of some potential importance, the Court concludes that, if the liability did not rank as a provable debt, it would not count as an expense of the administration [98] [114].
The Court also concludes that if it had taken a different view on the provable debt issue, it would not have held that it had a residual discretion to direct the administrator of a target company to accord to the potential liability under the FSD regime a higher ranking than it would be given under the relevant legislation [115] [127].
Lord Sumption adds some observations about the limitations on what constitutes an obligation incurred for the purpose of rule 13.12(1)(b) of the Insolvency Rules [129] [136].
","The Pensions Act 2004 (the 2004 Act) introduced a financial support direction (FSD) regime. The Pensions Regulator subsequently initiated machinery under the 2004 Act to require certain other group members the target companies to provide financial support for the Scheme.

uksc-2009-0098,"BA and PE were each served a deportation order after unsuccessful appeals on human rights and asylum grounds against the decision to deport them.
Both unsuccessfully made further submissions to the Secretary of State in an attempt to have the order revoked.
They then applied to judicially review the decision not to revoke the deportation order, maintaining that their removal from the United Kingdom would be in breach of their human rights. (Paras [3] [5]) This appeal concerns whether, once a claimant has had his appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State determined, he can make another appeal in country on the same grounds which were rejected on the earlier occasion.
The Secretary of State argued that a repetitive claim did not fall within section 92(4)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which provides for an in country appeal where the claimant has made an asylum claim, or a human rights claim whilst in the UK.
The Secretary of State argued that where, as in BAs case, further representations have not been advanced as a fresh claim as defined under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules, or, as in PEs case, have not been accepted as such by the Secretary of State, they can only be considered out of country and that there is no obstacle to the deportations. (Paras [8]; [13] [15])
The appeal by the Secretary of State is dismissed by a majority of four to one.
A claim for asylum which has been rejected should be allowed to proceed to appeal in country under sections 82 and 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, unless it has been certified as clearly unfounded under section 94 or excluded under section 96.
This should be so whether or not the Secretary of State has accepted it as a fresh claim. (Paragraph [32]) Lord Hope gave the majority judgment of the Court.
Lady Hale dissented.
Lord Hope considered the phrase an asylum claim, or a human rights claim in s 92(4)(a) in the context of the 2002 Act as a whole and rejected the Appellants argument that the Supreme Court should follow the interpretation in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Onibiyo [1996] QB 768.
In Onibiyo, claim in the context of the 1993 Act was held to mean a first claim, or a second or subsequent claim which has been accepted as a fresh claim by the Secretary of State, but not a claim which is repetitious.
Lord Hope determined that whilst the 2002 Act uses substantially the same words as the 1993 Act, the statutory system is markedly different given the
addition of a range of powers enabling the Secretary of State or immigration officer to deal with repetitious claims.
No inference was drawn from the amendment of s 113 by s 12 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 as it is not yet in force. (Paras [25] [29]; [44] [46]) In a case such as this where no certification has been given under s 94 (providing for the exclusion of appeals that are clearly unfounded) or s 96 (removing the right of appeal if the claim raises an issue which has been or ought to have been dealt with in an earlier appeal), there is no need to impose a further requirement which is not mentioned elsewhere in the 2002 Act, namely that the words aclaim exclude a further claim which has not been held under rule 353 to be a fresh claim. (Para [29]) The Appellants construction risks undermining the beneficial objects of the Refugee Convention, as it would exclude, by s 95, claims which the Secretary of State considers not to be fresh claims from the ground of appeal in s 84(1)(g), when claims which are certified as clearly unfounded under s 94 would still be given the benefit of that section. (Section 84(1)(g) provides for an appeal where removal would place the UK in breach of its international or human rights obligations.) (Paras [30][32]; [47]) Rule 353 does not affect the operation of the legislative scheme, which provides the complete code for dealing with repeat claims. (Para [33]) Lady Hale, dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.
Lady Hale concluded aclaim in s 92(4)(a) of the 2002 Act ought to be given the same meaning ascribed to the phrase in the 1993 Act in Onibiyo.
There was no need for it to be defined in the 2002 Act given it had already been judicially interpreted. (Paras [39][40]) The addition of sections 94 and 96 should not be taken to mean that Parliament had abandoned the old meaning of claim without expressly saying so, particularly as the additional sections are not apt to cater for repetitious claims. (Paras [41][42]) Lady Hale disagreed that the Appellants construction would undermine the UKs international obligations.
A person who presents a repeat claim on asylum or human rights grounds has already enjoyed the right of appeal on these grounds within this country.
The current system allowing for an initial decision followed by an appeal system in the UK is sufficient compliance with those obligations. (Paras [42] [43])
","BA and PE were each served a deportation order after unsuccessful appeals on human rights and asylum grounds against the decision to deport them. Both unsuccessfully made further submissions to the Secretary of State in an attempt to have the order revoked. They then applied to judicially review the decision not to revoke the deportation order, maintaining that their removal from the United Kingdom would be in breach of their human rights. Lord Hope gave the majority judgment of the Court. Lady Hale dissented.",0.1755485893416928,0.1717277486910995,0.1755485893416928,0.1755485893416928,9.546662830571088e-05
uksc-2010-0142,"This appeal concerns the relationship between two rights which enable non nationals to remain in the United Kingdom: humanitarian protection, which derives from European law, and asylum, which derives from a combination of domestic law, European law, and international law.
The issue in the appeal is whether, because a right of appeal exists against a refusal of an asylum application, European law requires that a right of appeal also be available against a refusal of an application for humanitarian protection.
FA is an Iraqi national who arrived unaccompanied in the United Kingdom in August 2007 when he was 15 years old.
He made an application for asylum which the Secretary of State refused on the grounds that his claim was not credible.
The Secretary of State also considered whether FA qualified for humanitarian protection and / or discretionary leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
Humanitarian protection is the domestic means of providing the subsidiary protection which Directive 2004/83/EC (the Qualification Directive), a European legislative instrument, requires to be given to certain third country nationals and stateless persons.
The Secretary of State decided that FA did not qualify for humanitarian protection, but granted him discretionary leave to remain until he was 17 and a half years old.
Section 83(2) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 entitled FA to appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal against the refusal of his claim to asylum.
FA made such an appeal and also appealed against the refusal of his claim for humanitarian protection.
The Tribunal dismissed both the asylum and humanitarian protection appeals, deciding in respect of the latter that no appeal was available to FA in relation to humanitarian protection.
On appeal to the Court of Appeal, FA relied upon the European law principle of equivalence.
This provides that, although it is for Member States to prescribe the procedural conditions necessary for the protection of European law rights, national rules regarding those procedural conditions must not be less favourable than those governing comparable domestic actions.
FA argued that he must be entitled to a right of appeal against the humanitarian protection decision since the lack of an appeal would mean that this claim, based as it was on European law, was being subjected to rules which were less favourable than those which applied to the asylum claim, such a claim being based on national law.
The Court of Appeal acceded to this argument and allowed FAs appeal.
The Secretary of State appealed to the Supreme Court against that decision.
The Supreme Court unanimously decides that a number of issues arise on the appeal which require a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Lord Kerr delivers the judgment of the panel.
The critical question on the appeal is whether the principle of equivalence requires that a right of appeal must be available against the decision to dismiss FAs application for humanitarian protection.
This in turn depends on whether there is a comparable domestic right which is subject to more favourable rules than his humanitarian protection right.
It is clear that the humanitarian protection claim is subject to less favourable rules than the asylum claim, given that the latter provides FA with an appeal against the initial refusal.
The issue, however, is whether the asylum claim is a legitimate comparator.
This issue has a number of aspects, in particular: (i) whether the comparator with the European law claim must be a purely domestic measure; (ii) what is required in order that the compared measures may be regarded as sufficiently similar; and (iii) the source of the procedural rights of the asylum applicant.
As to (i), on the one hand there is a consistent line of authority from the European Court of Justice to the effect that the domestic measure must be a purely domestic provision.
If comparison with another European law provision was possible, much of the underlying purpose of the equivalence principle would be subverted, given that the essential reason for the development of the principle was that a European law right should not suffer disadvantageous treatment relative to national law rights.
On the other hand, however, it might be inconsistent with the aim of eliminating discrimination and overly technical to preclude comparison with another right on the basis that the right could be branded as deriving partly from a European law source. [24] [25] As to (ii), various formulae have been employed in case law to describe the nature of the similarity that is required, including whether the purpose, essential characteristics and / or juristic structures of the two measures are the same.
There is much to be said for the view that the question of the required similarity and the criteria necessary to establish it in an individual case will depend on the context in which the application of the principle of equivalence is canvassed. [40] [42] As to (iii), the asylum claim is based on provisions that were enacted in pursuance of the United Kingdoms obligations under the Qualification Directive.
Yet they mirror requirements set out in the Refugee Convention, an instrument of international and not European law, and this may have been the original source of many of the provisions of the Qualification Directive.
Whatever the answer to (iii), however, it does not provide an answer to (i) and (ii).
Those essential questions have not been directly addressed by the European Court of Justice and for that reason a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is required. [47] The Supreme Court decides to make such a reference and invites the parties to make submissions on the precise questions to be referred. [48]

uksc-2013-0054,"The Appellant owns and occupies a mobile home that sits on a plot at Meadowview Park, a mobile homes site belonging to the Respondent.
He pays an annual pitch fee to the Respondent for licence to use the plot.
Under the terms of his agreement with the Respondent (the agreement), he is not permitted to act in such a way as to annoy or disturb other occupiers of Meadowview Park (the anti social behaviour covenant) [5].
Under the Mobile Homes Act 1983 (the 1983 Act), a site owner can only terminate an occupiers licence in certain limited circumstances [1].
This appeal concerns Paragraph 4 of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 1983 Act (para 4), which provides: The owner shall be entitled to terminate the agreement forthwith if, on the application of the owner, the appropriate judicial body (a) is satisfied that the occupier has breached a term of the agreement and, after service of a notice to remedy the breach, has not complied with the notice within a reasonable time; and (b) considers it reasonable for the agreement to be terminated.
Previously, Section 3(g) of the Mobile Homes Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) provided for the right of the owner to determine the agreement for breach of an undertaking, subject to the requirement, in the case of a breach which is capable of being remedied, that he has served written notice of the breach upon the occupier and has given the occupier a reasonable opportunity of remedying it (emphasis added).
However, in the 1983 Act any such clarification that the notice and reasonable time requirements only apply to remediable breaches was omitted [20].
The Appellant suffers some mental ill health, has a mild learning difficulty and exhibits autistic traits [6].
On 31 July 2006 he startled another resident of Meadowview Park, Miss Puncher, by jumping out at her from behind a tree wearing camouflage clothing [7].
In doing so he breached the anti social behaviour covenant.
On 15 August 2006 the Respondent wrote to the Appellant warning that he must not make unsolicited approaches to other residents, or the Respondent would apply to court to have the agreement terminated and his mobile home removed.
This letter amounted to notice to the Appellant to remedy his breach of the anti social behaviour covenant for the purposes of para 4 [8].
The Appellant did not commit any further breach until 15 July 2009, when he told another resident, Mr Carter, that two women had reported him for jumping out on them in the woods and he was going to kill them.
The Appellant then made threats to kill Mr Carter [10].
The Respondent applied to court for termination of the agreement [11].
On 17 August 2011 HHJ Moloney QC found that the requirements of para 4 were satisfied, granted the Respondents application and ordered that the Appellants licence to station his mobile home at Meadowview Park be terminated.
The Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal and his appeal was dismissed on 16 May 2012 [3].
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Appellants appeal against the order to terminate his licence to station his mobile home at Meadowview Park.
Lord Wilson gives the main judgment.
Lady Hale and Lord Toulson give concurring judgments.
Lord Carnwath (with whom Lord Reed agrees) gives a concurring judgment allowing the appeal for different reasons.
The panel reached the following conclusions as to the correct application of para 4: Whether para 4 applies to an irremediable breach Lord Wilson (with whom Lady Hale [44] and Lord Toulson [62] agree) holds that the notice requirement in para 4 applies only to a breach that is remediable [22]; it would be nonsensical to require service of a notice to remedy a breach which is incapable of remedy [20].
Lord Carnwath (with whom Lord Reed agrees) considers that a notice to remedy is required in all cases because the omission of limiting words in para 4 (such as the words in the 1975 Act, namely in the case of a breach which is capable of being remedied) must be regarded as deliberate [81].
The views of the court on this question are obiter dicta as the panel unanimously holds that the Appellants breach of 31 July 2006 was remediable [47] (see below).
Whether a breach of an anti social behaviour covenant can be remedied It is the unanimous view of the court that an occupier can in principle remedy a breach of an anti social behaviour covenant.
To decide if a breach is remediable requires a practical enquiry as to whether, and if so how, the mischief resulting from the breach can be redressed [31][52].
Some breaches are so serious as to be irremediable [37][53].
What constitutes compliance with a notice to remedy a breach of an anti social behaviour covenant Lord Wilson [37], Lady Hale [48] and Lord Toulson [63 64] hold that the occupier complies with a notice to remedy by not committing any further anti social behaviour for a reasonable time.
Lord Wilson explains that in cases involving breach of a negative obligation, the words within a reasonable time in para 4 must be read as meaning for a reasonable time [32].
Lady Hale characterises reasonable time as such time as is sufficient for the fears and anxiety caused by the anti social behaviour to calm down [48].
Lord Carnwath (with whom Lord Reed agrees) takes the minority view that that in the case of a negative user condition, compliance with a notice to remedy must continue indefinitely [90].
Whether the requirements of para 4 were satisfied in this case The mischief resulting from the Appellants breach of 31 July 2006, namely the alarm caused to Miss Puncher, was capable of being redressed [32].
In the view of the majority (Lord Wilson [36], Lady Hale [49] and Lord Toulson [65]) the period of almost three years during which the Appellant complied with the 15 August 2006 notice did amount to reasonable time.
Therefore, following the Appellants further breach on 15 July 2009, the Respondent ought to have served a fresh notice to remedy, or to have raised an allegation that this later breach was irremediable [36].
As it failed to do so, the agreement could not be terminated pursuant to para 4.
Lord Carnwath (and Lord Reed) would allow the appeal on the alternative basis that there needs to be a causal or temporal link between the notice to remedy and the subsequent breach [91] which was absent in this case [95].
